            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHat venimous and efficacious Influences Corruptions in Philoſophie diffuſe into Theologie and Chriſtianitie,<note place="margin">The firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie.</note> has been ſufficiently demonſtrated throughout the precedent Diſcourſe, <hi>touching the Vanitie of Philoſophie;</hi> as alſo by the late practices of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who have made it their principal concerne to adulterate Philoſophie, thereby to make it ſubſervient to their corrupt Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. And it has been to me for ſome while a ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, that Students in Philoſophie are compelled to have recourſe to the poiſoned ſprings of Jeſuitic Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, and therewith to imbibe many poiſonous infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Theologie. Hence it was that our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, obſerving what potent influences corrupt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie had on corruptions in Theologie, firſt attemted the Reformation of Philoſophie, and that in order to the Reformation of Theologic and Eccleſiaſtic Affaires. This noble and generoſe deſigne was begun by <hi>Wiclef,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wiclef.</note> that great <hi>Engliſh</hi> Apoſtle, who firſt begun to engage againſt Antichriſtian Dogmes in Philoſophic Diſputes; wherein he attained unto a great Eminence and Fame, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Bohemia:</hi> for <hi>John Huſſe</hi> was at firſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by <hi>Wiclefs</hi> Philoſophic Diſcourſes; who was indeed a perſon, not only of admirable Claritie in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating Divine Myſteries, but alſo of a marvellous acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to penetrate the ſecrets of Nature and Philoſophie. <hi>Wiclef</hi> was followed by <hi>Weſſelus Groningenſis,</hi> who,<note place="margin">Weſſelus.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:42100:3"/>by reaſon of his incomparable skil in al Sciences, was communly ſtiled, <hi>Lux Mundi.</hi> He was called by <hi>Philip</hi> the Elector Palatine to the profeſſion of Theologie at <hi>Heidelburg, Anno</hi> 1477. but being, by reaſon of his warm zele for Reformation, forced to leave his Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic profeſſion, he undertook that of Philoſophie, ſpecially <hi>Platonic;</hi> which he eſtimed moſt profitable and agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſtianiſme.<note place="margin">Savonarola.</note> The ſame generoſe deſigne was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed by <hi>Hieronymus Savonarola,</hi> in <hi>Italia,</hi> a perſon of great natural Acumen and Sagacitie as to Philoſophie, as wel as flagrant zele for Reformation. He reduced Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie to a more natural Forme and Method, rendring it ſubſervient to Theologie, ſo far as the Darkneſſe and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of thoſe times would permit; in which noble undertakement he made no ſmal progreſſe, as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by his Epitome of Philoſophie. To whom we may adde <hi>foarnes Picus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Picus Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula.</note> Prince of <hi>Mirandula</hi> and <hi>Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> a perſon of prodigioſe Parts and Learning; who was alſo very zeloſe in his Endeavors for the Reformation of Philoſophie, as wel as Eccleſiaſtic Diſcipline, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by his moſt elaborate and learned workes.</p>
            <p>Neither were there wanting ſome in the following Age, who ſpent indefatigable ſtudies and endeavors for the Reforming Philoſophie, in order to the Reformation of Theologie. Among thoſe <hi>Ludovicus Vives, Philip Melanchton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lud. Vives.</note> 
               <hi>Jacobus Faber Stapulenſis,</hi> and <hi>Peter Ramus</hi> deſerve immortal commemoration. <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> a perſon of ſingular parts and Intelligence in Philoſophie, made it his deſigne to detect the Vanitie and Abuſes of the Ariſtotelean Philoſophie, as depraved by the Scholaſtic Theologues. He addicted himſelf principally to the Platonic Philoſophie,<note place="margin">Phil. Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> as it appeares by his accurate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, in <hi>Auguſt de Civit. Dei. Philip Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> gave in like manner a very great advance to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb facs="tcp:42100:3"/>of Philoſophie: who was a perſon indued with a great Vivacitie of judgement, and dexterous Sagacitie, whereby he penetrated into the deepeſt Myſteries of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic Sophiſterie, as wel as Philoſophie. He excelled al Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of Philoſophie of his times: whence he is ſtiled by <hi>Hornius, Firſt Philoſ l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>The Author and Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of Philoſophie in Germanie:</hi> So much was the whole of Philoſophie refined by him. He illuſtrated <hi>Logic, Phyſic, Ethic</hi> and <hi>Mathematic</hi> Sciences; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to an excellent and uſeful Method: he pared off from Philoſophie a great quantitie of ſterile, inutile, ſpinoſe Queſtions, and clothed her with a more native evident habit or forme, whereby ſhe became Beautiful and Amiable. See more hereof in his life incomparably drawn by <hi>Joachimus Camerarius</hi> Alſo <hi>Jacobus Faber Stapulenſis</hi> is greatly renowned for his warme endeavors in order to the Reformation of Philoſophie,<note place="margin">Fab. Stapulenſis.</note> as wel as Theologie in <hi>France;</hi> for the which he ſuffered great Perſecutions by the Scholaſtic Theologues at <hi>Paris:</hi> yet was he preſerved by the Mediation of that illuſtrious Princeſſe <hi>Marguerite de Valois,</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre.</hi> It was this <hi>Stapulenſis,</hi> who, by his elaborate Lectures and Books, brought to light in the Univerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> that true <hi>Logic</hi> and <hi>Mathematics,</hi> in lieu of that Scholaſtic Sophiſterie, which before reigned there. That which is moſt marvellous in him is this, that being educated in the midſt of Barbariſme, he arrived to ſo great an Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Philoſophic Sciences and ingenuous Arts, as alſo of Theologie. <hi>Beza</hi> ſtiles him one of the moſt noble perſonages on earth, in regard of his Learning, Pietie, and generoſe deſignes for Reformation. Out of his Schole proceded many Learned men, who proved great Inſtruments of Reformation. But yet, I conceive, none deſerves a more illuſtrious Character among the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
<pb facs="tcp:42100:4"/>of Philoſophie,<note place="margin">Pet. Ramus.</note> than <hi>Peter Ramus,</hi> who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſteps of <hi>Faber Stapulenſis,</hi> for the Reforming of Logic and Philoſophie, as alſo of other ingenuous Arts; which lay buried under the Barbariſme of Scholaſtic Theologie. He at firſt profeſſed and taught the Liberal <hi>Arts, Philoſophie,</hi> and <hi>Mathematic</hi> Sciences in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege <hi>Prelaea;</hi> and afterward in the Royal College, at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> He moſtly inclined to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophie, greatly oppoſing <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which gain'd him the hatred of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus Carpentarius,</hi> profeſſor alſo of Philoſophie; whoſe Scholars imbrued their hands in <hi>Ramus</hi>'s bloud, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Maſſacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1572. This <hi>Ramus</hi> was a perſon of a very generoſe and flagrant zele for the Reformation of Eccleſiaſtic Diſcipline, as wel as Philoſophie.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how much our firſt zeloſe Reformers thought themſelves concerned for the Reformation of Philoſophie,<note place="margin">The right uſe and abuſe of Platonic Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie.</note> in order to a more pure Theologie. And indeed no wonder, ſince the main corruptions in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie have had their origine from ſome corruptions in Philoſophie, as it is ſufficiently demonſtrated throughout the precedent part of <hi>Vain Philoſophie.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like conſiderations gave the firſt Impreſſes and Impulſes to this our preſent undertakement, for the Reduction of Philoſophie to a more ſane and uſeful Forme and Method. And whereas in my firſt Conceptions I intended to have diſcourſed only hiſtorically of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophie, ſince finding upon a review of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophemes a very great Affinitie and Conformitie of mine own Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereto, I have diſcourſed more largely and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically thereon, reducing mine own ſentiments thereto; yet not without varietie of Reſtrictions, Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Amplifications, as the ſubſtrate mater may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And herein we are not without many Precedents both among the more Orthodoxe of the Fathers, as alſo
<pb facs="tcp:42100:4"/>our firſt Reformers. It's wel known, how much <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> that great Chriſtian Philoſopher, delighted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Studie of Platonic Philoſophie, even to ſome Intemperance, in that he affirmes, <hi>Apol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>That the Dogmes of Plato were not,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>aliene from thoſe of Chriſt</hi> And who knows not how much <hi>Auguſtin</hi> doth Platoniſe,<note place="margin">Auguſtinus noſter immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas Deo gratias agit, qùod ad ejus manus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venerint libri Platonicorum. <hi>Picus Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dul. Apol. p.</hi> 82.</note> in ſome of his moſt ſublime Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Yea, the noble <hi>Picus</hi> Earle of <hi>Mirandula</hi> aſſures us, <hi>that Auguſtin gave immenſe thankes to God, for the Platonic Books that came to his hands.</hi> So great uſe did his humble, Spiritual mind make of Platonic Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophemes, in order to the exaltation of free, efficacious Grace. So likewiſe among our firſt Reformers, <hi>Picus Mirandulanus, Savonarola, Weſſelus, Lud. Vives, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp;c.</hi> chiefly addicted themſelves to <hi>Plato,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Reformation of Philoſophie. Thus alſo <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> that great Patron of Efficacious Grace, greatly prefers Platonic Philoſophie before al other. Yea, may we not avouch, that the choiſeſt <hi>Phyſic</hi> or natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophemes entertained by our New-philoſophers, <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendus, Carteſius, &amp;c.</hi> are but <hi>Imitamens</hi> of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations laid down by <hi>Plato?</hi> This we have endeavored to make good, in our <hi>Philoſoph. General. P.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. Albeit that <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophie has been thus generally entertained by the beſt of Chriſtian Philoſophers, yet it cannot be denied, but that it has been the Prolific cauſe of the worſt Hereſies and Corruptions in the Church. For whence ſprang <hi>Arianiſme, Pelagianiſme, Myſtic Theologie,</hi> and may we not ſay the whole Complexum of <hi>Antichriſtianiſme,</hi> but from Platonic Philoſophie, profeſſed in the Schole of <hi>Alexandria?</hi> This is evidently demonſtrated in the precedent Part of the <hi>Vanitie of Philoſophie.</hi> Al this being granted, yet it follows not, but that Platonic Philoſophie may be greatly uſeful if wel
<pb facs="tcp:42100:5"/>managed, and rendred ſubſervient to Theologie, as in <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> Whereas <hi>Origen</hi> and his Sectators, the Monkes of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by their too fond eſtime of Platonic Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, and reduction of the Scriptures, yea the whole of Theologie to a ſubordination thereto, gave the firſt <hi>Formation,</hi> yea <hi>perfect Lineaments</hi> to the Man of ſin, and his Antichriſtian Theologie. I ſhal only adde on this Theme what <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in <hi>Cleomene,</hi> declares of the Stoic Philoſophie; <hi>If it fal on great and acute wits, it becomes lubricous, inordinate, and incertain; but if it be mixed with a ſerious, meek, and humble mind, it greatly conduceth to the true and proper good.</hi> So greatly uſeful may Platonic Philoſophie be, if loged in a ſerious, humble, meek, believing mind; which hath both Wiſdome and Grace to render the ſame ſubordinate to Theologie.</p>
            <p>But now having prefaced thus much touching the firſt Reformers of Philoſophie,<note place="margin">The Deſigne of this Diſcourſe to render Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie ſubſervient to Chriſtian Theologie.</note> and what Method may ſeem moſt conducible to the Reformation thereof, we may not conclude without ſome notices of the principal deſigne of this Diſcourſe, and our procedure therein. As for its original Deſigne, it is too too apparent, that our Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of late has received great damage and prejudice by the old Ariſtotelean Philoſophie, as Sophiſticated by the Jeſuites; as alſo by New-philoſophie, as abuſed by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtic wits: would it not then be a deſign of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo to Reforme Philoſophie, as to render it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger oppoſite, but ſubſervient to Theologie? How far we have attained hereto the Reader muſt be Judge.

               <note place="margin">Notional Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie or Logic</note> is either <hi>Notional,</hi> or <hi>Real. Notional</hi> Philoſophie, termed by the Platoniſtes <hi>Dialectic</hi> or <hi>Rational,</hi> becauſe the ancient mode of Reaſoning was by Dialogues, is now communly ſtiled <hi>Logic;</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly treats of <hi>Notions,</hi> either <hi>Simple</hi> or <hi>Complexe.

               </gap>, <hi>Imitamens</hi> or <hi>Ideas</hi> of things impreſſed on the mind, without either Affirmation or Negation: as the Notion or Idea we have of a <hi>Man, Horſe,</hi> or the like. <hi>Complexe</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are either <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> which, being compoſed of ſimple Notions, give ſome judgement of things; or <hi>Syllogiſmes and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,</hi> which are compoſed of Propoſitions; or <hi>Method,</hi> which is compoſed of ſimple Notions, Propoſitions, and Diſcourſes. Theſe are the four parts of Logic; which are taken from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>End,</hi> and anſwer to the four great Operations of the Mind. For what is the <hi>End</hi> of al Logic,<note place="margin">The End of Logic.</note> but <hi>to direct and conduct the Mind into the Cognition of things?</hi> Hence Logic is termed by <hi>Plato</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Organ</hi> or <hi>Key of al Sciences;</hi> whereby we are introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the Cognition of althings. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> made Logic the Organ of Philoſophie, yet no part thereof; but <hi>Plato</hi> made it both an Organ and Part. So <hi>Ammonius,</hi> as <hi>Court Gent. Part.</hi> 2. <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. §. 3. Of what great uſe <hi>Logic</hi> is, not only for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of Sciences, but alſo for the Reſtauration of the mind to its native <hi>Claritie</hi> and <hi>Acumen,</hi> in order to a right <hi>Apprehenſion, Judgement, Diſcourſe,</hi> and <hi>Method,</hi> in the Cognition or Diſquiſition of things, is moſt evident to any that underſtandes the Nature and Uſe thereof. Yea, according to the Idea I frame of Logic, the Clarifying and Rectifying of the Mind is its principal End, and that of the Acquiſition of Sciences much inferior thereto. For of what uſe are al natural Sciences, but to Clarifie and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Mind, for the contemplation of more Sublime and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects? So that to make uſe of Logic only as an Inſtrument or Key to Sciences is to deprive ourſelves of the principal uſe thereof; which is to <hi>Purifie</hi> and <hi>Refine</hi> the Intellect, in order to the more diſtinct, real and perfect knowlege of things, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42100:8"/>ſuch as are moſt Sublime and Divine. I no way dout, but that a judicious perſon, by the aide of Logic, may be greatly Aſſiſted and Capacitated for the more expedite exercice of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic</hi> or <hi>Politic</hi> Employments: but O! of what incomparable advantage might Logic be in Theologic Contemplations and Controverſies, were it but wel Reformed and ſeated in a ſolid, judicious, humble, ſerious, rectified Mind? So much for the End of Logic.</p>
            <p>The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilite</hi> of Logic may further appear if we conſider the <hi>Parts</hi> thereof;<note place="margin">The firſt part of Logic, about Simple Ideas or Notions.</note> which are four, anſwerable to the four Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind. 1. The prime or firſt Operation of the Mind conſiſtes in its <hi>ſimple Apprehenſion of things,</hi> without Affirmation or Negation, Judgement or Diſcourſe. This ſimple Apprehenſion of things is by <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Notions</hi> impreſſed on the Mind: Theſe Ideas or Notions ariſe either immediately from the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, conſidered in their real Natures and Attributes, or elſe from the Minds Comparation and Abſtraction: the former they cal <hi>firſt Notions;</hi> the later <hi>ſecond Notions.</hi> Again theſe Ideas and Notions may be conſidered, either in regard of their <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> namely their <hi>Clarite</hi> and <hi>Obſcuritie:</hi> or in regard of their <hi>Quantitie, i. e.</hi> their <hi>Extenſion</hi> or <hi>Reſtriction;</hi> their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalitie, Particularitie,</hi> and <hi>Singularitie.</hi> Now the mind of Man having been by the Fal much wounded and diſabled, as to the regular exerting this firſt Simple Apprehenſion of things, in order to the Acquirement of right Ideas and Notions, hence the firſt part of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic is to ſuccur and direct the mind in this its firſt Operation of ſimple Apprehenſion, for the procurement of Clear, Diſtinct, and real Ideas or Notions, both firſt, and ſecond, Univerſal, Particular,<note place="margin">Objective Ideas or Categories.</note> and Singular.</p>
            <p>And becauſe al Subjective Ideas or Notions of things ariſe from, and are indeed but <hi>Imitamens</hi> or <hi>Images</hi> of the things themſelves, hence Logic, (1) begins with the conſideration of the things themſelves, as they lie in their <hi>Objective Ideas,</hi> and are the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Exemplars of al <hi>Subjective Ideas</hi> or Notions impacted on the Mind. Logic handles theſe Objective Ideas, not as any part of its formal Object, but only as the Subſtrate Mater, or prime Elements, from which ſubjective Ideas and Notions ariſe. Theſe Objective <hi>Ideas</hi> or <hi>real Beings</hi> conſidered in Logic are reduced by the <hi>Ariſtoteleans,</hi> (from I know not what <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition) to <hi>Ten Categories</hi> or <hi>Predicaments;</hi> unto which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42100:8"/>al Beings are to be reduced, as to their proper Claſſes. But this Diſtribution being now generally exploded by al awakened ſpirits, yea diſapproved by ſome of the more candid <hi>Ariſtoteleans,</hi> we ſhal content our ſelves with this curt, yet apparently more native and diſtinct diſtribution of <hi>Beings. Ens,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> is either <hi>Infinite,</hi> or <hi>Finite. Infinite Being</hi> is but one, namely God, who having no termes of Eſſence, cannot admit termes of Definition; but doth every way tranſcend al Predicamental Confinement, as the ſober <hi>Ariſtoteleans</hi> acknowledge. <hi>Finite Ens or Being</hi> may be diſtributed into <hi>Subſtance,</hi> or <hi>Mode.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Subſtance.</note> [1] <hi>Subſtance</hi> is either <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcous</hi> or <hi>Corporeous: Incorporeous</hi> Subſtance is divided into <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> or <hi>Human Souls. Corporeous</hi> Subſtance is either <hi>Inanimate</hi> or <hi>Animate: Inanimate</hi> Bodies are either <hi>Simple,</hi> as the Three Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, with the four Elements, Fire, Air, Water, Faith: or <hi>Mixed;</hi> which are again divided into <hi>imperfectly</hi> mixed, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors: or <hi>Perfectly</hi> mixed, as Minerals, Metals and Plants. <hi>Animate Corporeous Subſtance</hi> is divided into <hi>Brutes,</hi> or <hi>Human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> Of al theſe we have copioſely Philoſophiſed, <hi>Philiſ. Gen. P.</hi> 1. <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. and <hi>Court Gent. P.</hi> 2. <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 9. [2] <hi>Mode</hi> is not a Complete <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Mode.</note> neither is it a mere <hi>Non-entitie</hi> or <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> but of a middle nature between a complete perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and nothing; or, as ſome properly terme it, <hi>Appendicula Rei,</hi> an <hi>Appendicule,</hi> or <hi>Little Appendix of a thing.</hi> A Mode is either <hi>Subſtantial</hi> and <hi>Eſſential,</hi> or <hi>Accidental.</hi> A <hi>Subſtantial and Eſſential</hi> Mode is that which Eſſentially adheres to the thing, and cannot, no not ſo much as by Mental Abſtraction, be ſeparated from the thing: ſo that to denie it of the thing Modified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, implies a ſlat contradiction, either Virtual or Formal. Thus Quantitie is a Mode Eſſentially appendent to and inſeparable from Corporeous Subſtance: in like manner al <hi>Proprieties</hi> are Eſſential Modes of the Subject they are proper to. <hi>Accidental Modes</hi> are ſuch as appertain not to the Eſſences of things, and therefore may be ſeparated, at leaſt <hi>Mentally,</hi> if not <hi>Really.</hi> Again Modes may be diſtributed into <hi>interne and externe:</hi> Union and Corporeous Formes are interne Modes; but Actions and Relations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne. Thus much for <hi>Single Objective</hi> Ideas loged in things.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) As for <hi>Simple Subjective Ideas,</hi> and <hi>Notions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Firſt Notions.</note> they are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ranged under theſe two Heads, of <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Notions. <hi>Firſt Notions,</hi> are ſuch as ariſe immediately from the thing it ſelf, or from the Comparation and Comprehenſion of ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42100:9"/>things under one commun Notion. Hence they may be diſtributed into <hi>Singular,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi> A ſingular firſt Notion or Idea is the ſimple <hi>Imitamen</hi> or <hi>Repreſentamen</hi> of ſome one indvidual thing in the mind: as the Idea of <hi>Alexander, Plato,</hi> or the like. An <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal firſt Notion,</hi> is that which comprehendes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentes many different Species, or Individuals: As <hi>Animal, Man, Brute.</hi> Theſe Univerſal Ideas or Notions are either <hi>Generic,</hi> as Animal;<note place="margin">Second Notions.</note> or <hi>Specific,</hi> as Man. <hi>Second Notions</hi> are only <hi>Termes of Art</hi> abſtracted and aſſumed by the buſy Mind, the more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to apprehend and expreſſe things. Al Diſciplines, ſpecially Organic, have certain termes of Art, whereunto they reduce things comprehended under thoſe Diſciplines. Such are the parts of ſpeech in Grammar, <hi>Noun, Pronoun, Verb, &amp;c.</hi> Thus in Logic there are certain Second Notions or Ideas, framed out of firſt Notions collated or compared together. As by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring al <hi>Animals</hi> together, we find there is one commun Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which they al agree, albeit they may have in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards their Specific Differences. Thus it appears, that al Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals agree as to <hi>Senſe, &amp;c.</hi> Thence we conclude that Animal is <hi>Genus:</hi> which is a ſecond Notion or Terme of Art, under which al Animals are involved. So that indeed theſe ſecond Notions are not <hi>Real,</hi> but only <hi>Mental</hi> or <hi>Rational Beings,</hi> framed out of Real Beings, and unto which al Real Beings are reduced, as to ſo many Artificial Claſſes.

[1] <hi>From two particular Propoſitions nothing regularly can be concluded.</hi> [2] <hi>From two Negatives nothing duely follows.</hi> For two negative Propoſitions ſeparate both Predicate and Subject from the middle terme. [3] <hi>The middle terme muſt once at leaſt either in the Major or Minor, be taken <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally.</hi> For if it may be taken twice Particularly, it may be taken for diverſe parts of the ſame whole: whence the termes of the Concluſion can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be rightly conjoined, nor ſeparated. As, <hi>Some Animal is a Man: Some Animal is a Beſte:</hi> Therefore <hi>ſome Beſte is a Man.</hi> [4] <hi>The Concluſion ever follows the weaker Part. i. e.</hi> If any one Propoſition be Particular or Negative, the Concluſion alſo is Particular or Negative.

            <p>Theſe general Rules for the right formation of a ſimple Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme being premiſſed,<note place="margin">Figures and Modes.</note> we procede to <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Modes,</hi> wherein the formal Conſtitution of a Syllogiſme is placed. <hi>A Figure is the regular Diſpoſition of the middle terme or Argument with the two extremes, or the parts of the Queſtion. A Mode is the regular diſpoſition of the three Propoſitions, according to their differences as to Quantitie or Qualitie:</hi> which Logicians expreſſe by theſe four vowels, <hi>A, E, I, O. A</hi> denoting an Univerſal Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative; <hi>E,</hi> an Univerſal Negative; <hi>I,</hi> a particular Affirmative; <hi>O,</hi> a particular Negative. There are <hi>three Figures.</hi> (1) In the <hi>firſt Figure</hi> the middle terme or Argument is the Subject in the major and the Predicate in the minor Propoſition: hence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>middle</hi> not only as to <hi>Office</hi> but <hi>Site.</hi> This firſt Figure has four Modes, expreſſed by certain termes of Art, whoſe vowels expreſſe the Quantitie and Qualitie of the Propoſition annexed thereto. As [1] <hi>Barbara:</hi> which notes each Propoſition in the firſt mode to be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> and <hi>Affirmative.</hi> [2] <hi>Celarent:</hi> which notes the firſt Propoſition to be Univerſal and Negative; the ſecond, Univerſal and Affirmative; the third, Univerſal and Negative. [3] <hi>Darij:</hi> which notes the firſt Propoſition to be an Univerſal Affirmative; the ſecond and third particular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatives. [4] <hi>Ferio:</hi> which notes the firſt Propoſition to be an Univerſal Negative; the ſecond a particular Arffimative; the third a particular Negative. Of theſe Modes two are Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, two Negative: the Affirmative are grounded on this principe: <hi>Whatever agrees to an Idea or Notion taken <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, agrees alſo to al that which is comprehended within the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Idea or Notion.</hi> Or thus: <hi>Whatever is affirmed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Idea or Notion, is alſo affirmed of al that is contained under that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Idea.</hi> Thus the Notion of <hi>Senſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to al Animals; therefore to al Men and Brutes. The Negative modes are founded on this principe: <hi>Whatever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of any Idea or Notion taken <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally, is denied alſo of al that, of which that Idea or Notion is affirmed.</hi> Or thus: <hi>Whatever is denied <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally of any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Notion, is alſo denied of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things contained under that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Notion.</hi> Thus a Brute is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Univerſally of al men; therefore alſo of <hi>Peter, John, &amp;c.</hi> This firſt Figure hath two Rules, [1] <hi>The major ought alwayes to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi> [2] <hi>The miner ought alwayes to be Affirmative.</hi> The perfection of this firſt Figure, beyond that of the ſecond or third,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42100:11"/>conſiſtes in theſe two particulars. [1] In that al manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Affirmatives, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Negatives, Particular Affirmatives, Particular Negatives</hi> may be concluded herein: whereas in the ſecond Figure the Concluſion can be only <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and in the third only <hi>Particular.</hi> [2] In that the neceſſitie of the Syllogiſme conſequence appears more evidently in this firſt Figure, than in the ſecond or third. Hence it is, that Logicians adviſe, that our Arguments be, ſo far as it may be, reduced to this firſt Figure; for which they give us many uſeful Rules. (2) In the ſecond Figure the middle terme is the predicate both in the major and minor Propoſition. The Modes of this Figure are four, expreſſed by thoſe fictitioſe termes of Art: <hi>Ceſare, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtres, Feſtino, Baroco.</hi> The Rules of this Figure are two. [1] <hi>The Major ought alwaies to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi> [2] <hi>One of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, and thence alſo the Concluſion muſt be ever Negative.</hi> (3) <hi>In the third Figure the middle terme or Argument is the ſubject in both Premiſſes.</hi> Its Modes are ſixe: <hi>Darapti, Eclapton, Diſamis, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſi, Bocardo, Feriſon.</hi> Its Rules are two. [1] <hi>The Minor muſt be Affirmative.</hi> [2] <hi>The Concluſion muſt be Particular.</hi> So much for the Conſtitution of ſimple Syllogiſmes: whereunto we muſt alſo reduce <hi>Enthymemes;</hi> which are imperfect ſimple Syllogiſmes, curtail'd of ſome one of the Premiſſes, which lies <hi>latent</hi>

            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Compoſite Syllogiſme</hi> is twofold: (1) That which has one or both Premiſſes Compoſite: This is either <hi>Hypothetic,</hi> or <hi>Disjunctive,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Compoſite Syllogiſme. Hypothetic.</note> or <hi>Relative.</hi> [1] An <hi>Hypothetic Syllogiſme,</hi> is that wherein the Major, or Minor, or both Propoſitions are Hypothetic. If the Major only be Hypothetic, the Concluſion is Categoric: but if the Minor be Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetic, the Concluſion alſo muſt be Hypothetic.<note place="margin">Disjunctive.</note> [2] A <hi>Disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Syllogiſme</hi> is that whoſe Major is Disjunctive: which if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte only of two members immediately oppoſite, we may argue from the Poſition of the one, to the Remotion of the other; or from the Remotion of the one, to the Poſition of the other. If the Major has more members than two, ſome being removed, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains is concluded. When upon the Remotion of both or al the members the whole is removed, the Syllogiſme is from the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the parts. [3] A <hi>Relative</hi> Syllogiſme is that whoſe Major includes a relation of the parts.<note place="margin">Relative.</note> (2) A Syllogiſme compoſed of many Syllogiſmes is either a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> or <hi>Sorites.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dilemma.</note> [1] A <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma</hi> is an argumentation from two members, whereof both
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42100:12"/>are attended with incommoditie. It conſiſtes of a disjunctive Syllogiſme, wherein from the Remotion of the parts we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Remotion of the whole;<note place="margin">Sorites.</note> and two Categorics, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the remotion of the parts is confirmed. [2] A <hi>Sorites</hi> is an Argumentation conſiſting of many Propoſitions, ſo connected, that the predicate of the precedent Propoſition is the ſubject of the ſubſequent; and thence the laſt predicate concludes of the firſt ſubject. Thence a Sorites contains ſo many Syllogiſmes as there are termes between the ſubject of the firſt Propoſition, and the predicate of the laſt: as in that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth part of Logic is touching <hi>Method,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Method.</note> which directes the fourth operation of the Mind, called <hi>Diſpoſition.</hi> For the mind of man, ſo far as rectified, is the <hi>Orderer</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſer</hi> both of Notions and Things: and the principal End and Office of <hi>Method</hi> is to ſuccur and aſſiſt the mind in the ordering and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of notions and things. And look as Syllogiſme cures the Mind of Errors, ſo Method of Confuſion. Yea indeed, to ſpeak the truth, <hi>Method</hi> is very influential on al the former parts of Logic, as alſo on the operations of the mind, about which they are converſant: For how can the mind define, or divide, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly explicate ſimple Ideas and Notions without Method? How imperfect and confuſed wil its Judgements, Ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Diſcourſes be, unleſſe Method aſſiſt? Hence the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, <hi>Plato,</hi> and others, reduced the whole of Logic to Method, which without al peradventure is the moſt utile part thereof, if not Comprehenſive of the whole. In the general, <hi>Method is an Art, whereby the Mind is rendred capable rightly to diſpoſe a ſeries of many ſimple Notions or Apprehenſions, Judgements, and Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinations, in order to the Inveſtigation, Explication, and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth; as alſo the deeper impreſſion thereof on the Memorie.</hi> In this deſcription we have both the Object, Ends, and Effects of Method. The Object of Method is, (1) <hi>Simple Notions and Apprehenſions.</hi> Wherein we are to conſider their <hi>Definition</hi> and <hi>Diſtribution:</hi> In the <hi>Definition</hi> we are to conſider, [1] The <hi>Name.</hi> And herein the principal care is to clear the Name from al Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and Equivocation: which is beſt performed by an Examen of and Inquiſition into its <hi>Etymologie,</hi> or <hi>Origination, Homonymie,</hi> and <hi>Synonymie.</hi> [2] <hi>The Definition of the Thing;</hi> which muſt be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in termes moſt known and eſſential: for what is a Definition but the Idea or manifeſtation of a Thing? As for <hi>Diſtribution,</hi> it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42100:12"/>is of the whole into its parts; which gives a diſtinct Idea or Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a thing. (2) Another Object of Method is, <hi>Propoſitions and Judgements.</hi> Wherein we are to avoid al <hi>Precipitance, Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Prejudice;</hi> giving to al Propoſitions that Meaſure of Aſſent as their inſite Reaſon, or Autoritie requires; admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing as certain or evident, but what we know or have reaſon to believe is certainly or evidently true. (3) The laſt object of Method is <hi>Ratiocination</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi> Wherein we are [1] To leave nothing ambiguous or obſcure in the Termes. [2] To deduce al Ratiocinations from principes moſt certain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in themſelves, ſuch as no one inveſted with commun ſenſe may gainſay. For firſt principes give evidence and force to al concluſions, but receive none from them. [3] Al Cogitations and Ratiocinations employed for the Inveſtigation of Truth, or Remotion of any error muſt be digeſted and ranged into the moſt natural order: beginning from things more general, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and eaſily to be known; and thence paſſing on to things more difficult and compoſite. [4] In ſeeking out Arguments and examining Difficulties there muſt be a complete enumeration of all ſingulars and parts, with a diſtribution proportionable thereto; that ſo nothing be omitted, that may conduce to the examen of truth.

                     <p>§. 2. Next to the generic Notion of Moral Philoſophie,<note place="margin">The last End its Influence in Morals.</note> the firſt thing that comes under conſideration is the <hi>laſt End,</hi> which is firſt in intention, though laſt in execution.

Is not every thing then rightly diſpoſed, when it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently brought into a ſubordination to its laſt end? Wherefore the contemplation of the laſt end is of greateſt moment in Moral Philoſophie. And they ſay, that <hi>Plato</hi> was the firſt that uſed the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

This <hi>Cicero</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets <hi>extreme, last, chiefeſt.</hi> What force, efficace and influence the laſt end has in Morals, <hi>Plato</hi> frequently inculcates. So in his <hi>Theaetetus,</hi> he aſſures us, <hi>That al Science is inutile, yea noxious, without the notice of the beſt End.</hi> This laſt End he makes to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the principal End of althings:</hi> which <hi>Proclus</hi> cals, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the End of Ends.</hi> And for the more ful and clear explication of this <hi>laſt End,</hi> its univerſal influence and excellence, the following Propoſitions are diligently to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>It is neceſſarie, that we conſtitute ſome laſt End, as wel poſititively as negatively, in every Series of Actions.</hi> This Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is wel argued by <hi>Suarez, Metaph. Diſput.</hi> 24. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. And the reaſon is moſt evident: for look as in <hi>Deſcent</hi> from the intention of the end to the election and execution of the means, we muſt neceſſarily at laſt ſtop in ſome one or more means, which are firſt in execution, though laſt in intention; ſo in <hi>Aſcent</hi> from the means to the end, it is as neceſſary that we at laſt ſtop in ſome laſt end, which is firſt in intention and laſt in execution. Again, as there is a ſubordination of ſecond Cauſes to the firſt Cauſe; ſo in like manner of inferior Ends to the laſt End. For in Ends, and thoſe things that conduce thereto, there cannot be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe into infinite; but as there is a firſt means from whence the motion begins; ſo there muſt be a laſt end, in which it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates. In Ends there is a twofold order, (1) <hi>of Intention,</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42100:26"/>(2) <hi>of Execution:</hi> and in both orders there muſt be a firſt and a laſt. That which is firſt in the order of Intention is as it were the Principe, which moves the appetite, and gives bounds to it; and therefore can be no other than the laſt End: that which is firſt in the order of Execution, is the firſt means conducing to the laſt End. So that a progreſſe into infinite is on neither part poſſible: if there were not a laſt end, nothing could be deſired, no action of the appetite could be terminated, neither would the intention of the Agent ever ceaſe: if there were not a firſt means, from whence the execution ſhould begin, no Agent could begin to worke, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>The laſt End of althings muſt be as extenſive and ample, as the first Principe or Cauſe.</hi> Thus <hi>Plato, de Leg.</hi> 4 <hi>p.</hi> 715. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>God, (as the old Tradition teſtifies) having in himſelf the Principe, and End, and Medium of althings.</hi> In which he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indigitates, <hi>That God is the first Cauſe and last End of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things.</hi> That the laſt End is as large as the firſt Principe is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe the order of Ends muſt correſpond and anſwer to the order of Agents: as they who are under God, ought not <hi>morally,</hi> neither can they <hi>phyſically</hi> move, but as dependent on the motion and concurſe of God, the firſt Cauſe; ſo neither ought they to deſire any thing under God, but what may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to God as their laſt End. Such as the Univerſalitie of the firſt Cauſe is in giving Being or Welbeing; ſuch is the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie of the laſt End in requiring and calling for the emprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of al. Neither doth man pay the homage due to his firſt Cauſe, farther than his regreſſe thereto anſwers his progreſſe therefrom. God as the firſt Principe gives Being, and as the laſt End terminates and ſixeth the Being conferred. Wherefore the Creature that dependeth on God as the firſt Cauſe, muſt tend to him as his laſt End.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Prop. <hi>The laſt End of althings can be but one.</hi> This Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis both <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> concord in. And the reaſon is moſt apparent; becauſe althings deſire their utmoſt perfection, which conſiſtes in their tendence to the moſt perfect Being. Now the moſt perfect Being can be but one: For if there ſhould be more than one moſt perfect, then the one would have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which the other hath not; and ſo neither would be moſt perfect. Every good by the addition of ſome other good is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42100:26"/>made better and more perfect, except the moſt ſimple and perfect Good, by the participation whereof al other goods are made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Hence</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Prop. <hi>Every man, in every human Act, virtually, if not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, intends ſome laſt End.</hi> This is manifeſt; becauſe in every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Act ſomething is deſired for it ſelf, which cannot be referred to any other thing: and what is this but ſome laſt end? Again, man naturally deſireth the complement of al good: and albeit there may not be an actual elicite intention in every man as to his laſt end, yet there is a natural propenſion thereto; whence procede al Acts about particular goods.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Prop. <hi>The last End is deſired infinitely, without end or termes.</hi> Thence <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> (following <hi>Plato</hi> herein) in his <hi>Magn. Moral. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. defines the laſt End thus: <gap reason="foreign">

As to take away the firſt Cauſe of our Being, ſuppoſeth us not to be; ſo to take away the laſt End, ſuppoſeth a confuſed infinitie as to acting. Therefore ſomething muſt be ſimply deſirable for it ſelf and for no other: For that which a man deſireth in order to a further end, the ſame he deſireth in ſuch a meaſure as is moſt conducible to that end: but what he deſireth for it ſelf, towards that his deſire is infinite: for the better it is, the more deſirable: therefore if infinitely good infinitely deſirable, without termes or bounds. The only meaſure of loving our laſt End is to love it without meaſure: for the laſt End being the terme of the appetite, it may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive termes or limits from any other thing; but by how much the more it is loved, by ſo much the better is the love. In al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things appetible the laſt End gives meaſure but receives none; becauſe the proper reaſon of althings we deſire is taken from the End. Hence</p>

To make Muſic beautiful, there is required not only that the voices be clear and wel diſtinguiſhed, but alſo that they be conjoined in ſuch ſort one to t'other, that they make one juſt conſonance and harmonie, by means of the union that is in the diſtinction, and the diſtinction that is in the union of the voices, which may deſervedly be called a <hi>diſcordant Accord,</hi> or rather an <hi>accordant Diſcord.</hi> Hence (2) <hi>Al Beautie</hi> ariſeth from <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Integritie</hi> of parts.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42100:29"/>things are moſt beautiful in their kind, which are moſt perfect: And is not the chiefeſt Good moſt abſolutely and ſimply perfect? (3) The laſt and main Cauſe of Beautie is <hi>Splendor, Light</hi> and <hi>Claritie.</hi> Thence Beautie is defined by <hi>Plato</hi> the <hi>Fulgor and Luſtre of Good. Splendor</hi> and <hi>Brightneſſe</hi> is eſſential to Beautie, to the end that it may be viſible or intelligible. Obſcurities, Shadows, and Darkneſſes are deformed, and render althings deformable; becauſe nothing in them is viſible or intelligible: neither order, nor diſtinction, nor union, nor convenance. So <hi>Job</hi> 10.22. in the deſcription of the grave, he ſaith, <hi>It is a land of darkneſſe, as darkneſſe it ſelf, and of the ſhadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkneſſe: i.e.</hi> There is no light, therefore no order and beautie. Light gives life to brightneſſe; which is but a dead inutile thing, if ſplendor and beautie give not life and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace to it, as we ſee in lively colors. So in man, his beautie is not accompliſht without a good grace and luſtre, which is the life of beautie.

Whence <hi>Aquinas</hi> defines <hi>Beautie, A certain bland face of Bonitie or Goodneſſe.</hi> And do not al theſe notions of beautie greatly illuſtrate the ſurpaſſing heart-raviſhing Beautie of God the chiefeſt Good?

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilitie of any created good conſiſtes not in its own goodneſſe, but in its reference to our laſt end.</hi> Herein conſiſtes the good of every inferior good, when it ſubſerves and tends to our chiefeſt good. The good and evil of althings is to be judged by their relation to, or diſtance from the laſt end. Things are ſo far good as they enable us to do good by ſerving God. Al that we have, or can do is of God, and therefore ought to be for God. Nothing is to be loved or enjoyed for it ſelf, but the chiefeſt good. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle, Eth. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Thoſe things that come under <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, we may uſe either wel or il. Thus Riches are reckoned among utile goods. Now he that is endowed with virtue for the uſe of any thing, doth uſe that thing in the beſt manner. Therefore he uſeth riches beſt, which hath attained to that virtue, which belongs to the uſe thereof.</hi> Thus riches and al other lower goods muſt be referred to God. Hence</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To uſe any thing, is to refer it to ſome other thing ſuperior in our eſtime.</hi> Herein conſiſtes the formal difference between Uſe and Fruition: Things are enjoyed for themſelves their own goodneſſe; but they are uſed in order to ſomething elſe. We do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>enjoy,</hi> but <hi>uſe</hi> the means, neither <hi>uſe</hi> but <hi>enjoy</hi> our laſt end. Hence it follows (1) That al Uſe of God as a means for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of ſome other end is inordinate. (2) That al Uſe of the Creature, which is not referred to God, is alſo ſinful. This perverſitie and inordination is found in every ſin, whiles men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy what they ought to uſe, and uſe what they ought to enjoy. This <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes to be the perverſion of al order, <hi>fruendis uti velle, at<expan>

Wherefore ſeing God alone is ſuperior to the rational Creature, he ought, according to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the Pondus of Love to ſubject himſelf to God only: which ſo long as he continues to do, he remains juſt and virtuoſe, and moſt ordinate in his kind; ſithat virtue is the beſt ſtate of a rational Creature; or, according to <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> nothing elſe but the <hi>order of Love:</hi> and by Love, as by a weight, the Soul is kept in this middle ſtate, under God the moſt ſupreme Being, and above inferior Creatures. This therefore is the bitter root of al inordinate motion, when the Soul doth by its love, as a terrene Pondus, move inordinately towards the Creatures, ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubject to them. Yea, doth not this perverting the order of Love bring the whole Creation under bondage, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.21, 22.</note>22? Wherein conſiſtes the preſent bondage of the Creatures, but in this, that they are perverted and turned aſide from that <hi>Order</hi> for which they were made, namely from the ſerving their Creator, to feed the luſts of men? The Creatures are not put to that uſe for which they were made by God, and this makes them groan to be delivered, &amp;c. Herein conſiſtes the Libertie of al Creatures, and our Libertie in the uſe of them, that we are thereby made more free in the ſervice and fruition of God; by ſubjecting our ſelves and al inferior goods to God, for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and enjoyment of him, we gain dominion over our ſelves and althings elſe. But if the heart be inordinate in adhering to or uſe of the moſt lawful comforts, we immediately fal under bondage to them. The way to have the Spirit free in the uſe of any created good, is not to uſe or enjoy it too much, by letting the Spirit to run too far into it, or loving it for it ſelf: for thereby we become ſlaves it.</p>

                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42100:33"/>which is only a conditionate, ſaint, imperfect volition of an end, without regard to the means. The more ſtrongly and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we intend our end, the ſooner ſhal we arrive thereto in the uſe of means:<note place="margin">Mat. 6.22.</note> a ſingle ſtrait intention keeps the Agent ſtrait in its way to its end. Thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.22. <hi>If therefore thine eye, i.e.</hi> the intention of thy wil, <hi>be ſingle, i.e.</hi> if it hath a ſingle end, namely God. <hi>Janſenius,</hi> out of <hi>Augustine, Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>pag.</hi> 162. informes us, that althings are to be referred to God, not only by <hi>habitual Intention,</hi> as the Scholes determine, but alſo by an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>virtually actual.</hi> And he thus demonſtrates it: becauſe the mind, when it acts, muſt requieſce in the love, not of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of God. For this is moſt certain, according to <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> that an <hi>habitual Intention</hi> only without <hi>actual</hi> or <hi>virtual</hi> wil not ſuffice; becauſe the juſt, when aſleep, have habitual intention, yet they cannot then be ſaid to refer their actions to God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is always neceſſary an <hi>actual,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>virtual</hi> intention of referring althings to God. A virtual intention in human acts hath the ſame force as actual intention: for it acts in virtue and force received from ſome former actual intention. As when a man in a journey is carried on towards his end by a virtual inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, influenced by ſome former actual intention. A right inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the deliberation of a bended wil towards God as the laſt end: for where the intention is right, God is the predominant end. The end of an action diſcovers its kind: and the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſcovers the end: For intention properly belongs to the Wil, whoſe office it is to refer al to the laſt end. The intention is the guard of the thoughts and deſires, that which girds up the mind, and keeps it fixed on its laſt end, in the uſe of al means. He that doth not intend and eye God in his worldly concernes, wil not intend him in his beſt duties and ſervices. To have the intention of the Wil actually directed towards God in al inferior goods is the Spirit of right Uſe. And herein indeed conſiſtes much of the Souls libertie as to means, to intend God in al. It's a good Notion of <hi>Aquinas, That the Soul, by intending temporals in order to God, is elevated and advanced; otherwiſe it is depreſſed and brought down,</hi> namely when it intends any temporal thing for it ſelf. Thus alſo <hi>Janſenius,</hi> in his <hi>Auguſt. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 40. where he gives this difference between <hi>

                        <q>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is loved as an end, which a man deſires to enjoy and to be bleſſed therein, that rules over the Lover: for this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42100:33"/>between Uſe and Fruition, that the Wil depreſſeth it ſelf under what it enjoys, but it elevates it ſelf above what it uſeth: ſo that it is a Servant of that which it enjoys, but Lord over what it makes uſe of.</q> This inferior viſible World what is it but a Map of things inviſible? And ought we not then firmely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend God in al theſe lower things? And is not this the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect uſe, when the Soul doth ſpiritually and actually contemplate, intend, and adhere to God in al theſe lower goods of time? As Intention directs the Wil, ſo Faith directs the Intention in the uſe and proſecution of al means: it is the Intention that regulates the qualitie of the action in the uſe of things; and it is divine Faith and Love that regulate the Intention. This is wel explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and demonſtrated by <hi>Greg. Ariminenſis,</hi> 2. <hi>Sent.

Hence, according to the bonitie or pravitie of the Intention, we may take a meaſure of the bonitie or pravitie of Uſe: Every Intention of the Agent, wherein any thing but God is intended as the laſt end, is a depraved Intention: becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be intended for it ſelf but the laſt end. Whence it follows, that no Intention is right or morally good, but that whereby we intend or love for it ſelf, that which ought to be intended or loved for it ſelf, namely the laſt end and chiefeſt good, uſing and referring althings elſe, as means ſubordinate thereto, as it is acutely demonſtrated by <hi>Ariminenſis,</hi> in 2. <hi>Sent.

(3) <hi>No <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is Fruition:</hi> becauſe no one that wils a thing for another, can be ſaid to wil that thing as his laſt end: becauſe the volition of the laſt end is the cauſe of the volition of that which refers to that end: but nothing can be the cauſe of it ſelf: <hi>Ergo.</hi> (4) <hi>Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe may conſiſt together in the Wil, as to different objects.</hi> (5) <hi>The Wil ought not to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe God: i. e.</hi> as a means conducible to ſome other end. (6) <hi>A Love of Fruition muſt terminate no where but on God.</hi> (7) <hi>To love any thing for God, is nothing elſe than to love it, becauſe God is loved: i. e.</hi> to love it as conducible to God. In Fruition there are four conſiderables, (1) <hi>Love.</hi> (2) <hi>Poſſeſſion of and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Object beloved.</hi> (3) <hi>Communion.</hi> (4) <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and joy.</hi> Of theſe in their order.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Al Fruition imports <hi>Love.</hi> For no man can enjoy what he doth not love: al Love tends to Union, ſpecially with its laſt end: Yea, according to the Scholes, there is a mutual Inheſion between the <hi>Lover</hi> and <hi>Beloved.</hi> The Lover lives in the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Beloved in the Lover: which is moſt true in regard of that Love of Fruition, whereby the Soul enjoys God: for God lives in the Soul that loves him, and the Soul lives in God, who is eſſential Love.

Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 40. Love of Fruition ordains and diſpoſeth the <hi>Love</hi> towards its <hi>Beloved:</hi> whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards as its firſt Principe or Cauſe, and its laſt end, in the fruition of which it expects perfect felicitie. For what is <hi>Fruition</hi> but this, to adhere to and acquieſce in another as its firſt principe and laſt end? But now every thing that is ordained to another, is in that reſpect neceſſarily inferior to that other. Whence Love of Fruition keeps the Soul in ſubjection to God its laſt end, but gives it dominion over every inferior good. This <hi>Janſenius</hi> more fully explicates, <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>pag.</hi> 149. Many, ſaith he, thinke they love not ſuch things, to which they are indeed intimately and ſtrongly united: but this is with facilitie detected by Fruition: for <hi>Love</hi> cannot be wel underſtood without <hi>Fruition,</hi> nor yet <hi>Fruition</hi> without <hi>Love;</hi> becauſe Love is the beginning of Fruition, and Fruition the end of Love. No man enjoys but what he loves; and no man loves any thing as his laſt end, but what he would enjoy: whence, as there is no Fruition but what is ſweetened with Love, ſo there is no Love but what tends to Fruition. Therefore Love, according to <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is nothing elſe but the Wil, by its <hi>Pondus,</hi> tending to Fruition. What is Love, but a ſecret Fountain ſtreaming towards Fruition? And what is Fruition, but an Ocean of ſatisfaction, in which Love is immerſed and ſwallowed up? Is not then Fruition near akin to Love? Thence <hi>Augustine,</hi> explicating the nature of Fruition, tels us, that to enjoy, <hi>is to adhere to a thing for it ſelf:</hi> for if it be not adhered to for it ſelf, it is not properly loved or enjoyed, but that other thing, for whoſe ſake it is embraced. But to ſpeak preciſely, every kind of Love is not Fruition, but that only which ſolaceth it ſelf in the embracements of its beloved: which if ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the wil moves towards it by deſires. This is wel expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Plato, Phaedro, pag.</hi> 251. <gap reason="foreign">

And thus variouſly affected, by reaſon of impatient furie, it cannot ſleep, but wanders up and down with deſire to ſee the first Beautie: which when it has once got a glance of, then breaking al

By al which it is apparent, (1) That al Fruition of, or love to any Creature for it ſelf is ſinful concupiſcence.

Thus <hi>Aquinas,</hi> 2.2. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 179. <hi>Art.</hi> 1. <q>Every thing manifeſtes its life by that operation which is moſt proper to it, and whereunto it is chiefly inclined: Now, in as much as Contemplation is the proper act of man whereunto he is moſt inclined, and wherein he delights moſt, it follows, that herein the main of his life conſiſtes.</q> To contemplate the firſt cauſe and laſt end of althings how delicious and agreable is it! Contemplation binds the mind to its object, and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly transformes it thereinto. Is it not ſweet to the eye to contemplate light? And is not the laſt end the prime light of the Soul? Doth not the contemplation of our laſt end give us a divine light to improve al other objects we converſe with? And are not althings hereby turned into God? Doth not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of God, as our choiceſt Good, enable us to live in God, and to him?</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) But yet together with Contemplation there muſt be <hi>divine Love</hi> and <hi>Complacence,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Love.</note> which is another part of the Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with its laſt end. Contemplation brings in the chiefeſt Good into the Soul; but divine Love carries out the Soul to it, by adherence to, and delight in it. The amorous Soul living in God by love, dies in it ſelf. How many artifices doth divine Love uſe for the enjoyment of its choiceſt Good? As man loſt God by loving the Creature more than God; ſo by loving God more than the Creature he again finds God, and ſatisfaction in him. Love to God ſettles the Soul in one point, out of which it needs not ſtir to find Felicitie.<note place="margin">Dulcius eſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare quàm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mari. <hi>Sen.</hi>
                        </note> A Soul thus inſpired with the flames of divine Love has a little Heaven in it. The Stoic thinkes it <hi>ſweeter to love than to be beloved.</hi> Certainly divine Love is moſt <hi>unitive</hi> and <hi>perfective:</hi> it has a violence and pain, which is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42100:36"/>moſt ſweet and delicious. The Soul by loving its laſt end <hi>poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, enjoys,</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> in it. Have not althings a deſire of union and communion with what they love? And the more vehement our love is, if it be of the chiefeſt good, the ſweeter our fruition thereof is. This love gains ſtrength by oppoſition: it makes the moſt difficult ſervice ſweet. The only limits this victorious divine Love propoſeth to it ſelf, is to have no limits. Where ever the Soul turnes it cannot but feel dolors, if it acquieſce not in God; but ſo far as it adheres to God, it feels no pain. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> that great Doctor of Love to God, compriſed al Chriſtian Morals in Love; which is the plenitude of the Law and our beſt Inſtructor in every Dutie. It is a luminous fire that diſcovers things moſt ſecret, and penetrates things moſt profound: it is an incomparable Antidote againſt human corruption. Whence alſo <hi>Auguſtine</hi> termed al <hi>Virtue but the order of Love:</hi> and its admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble efficace is ſeen in this, that it doth lift the heart above al things create, and yet at the ſame time depreſſe it at the loweſt centre of ſelf-nothingneſſe. Al the labors of this Love are ful of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſuavities, and carrie their rewards in them: Afflictions blunt not its edge: caſt it into an ocean of miſerie, and it ſwims above al: it eſtimates its miſerie only by the loſſe, and its Beatitude only by the fruition of its laſt end. Mediocritie, which in other things is eſtimed Vertue, is a Vice in Love to God, which admits no exceſſe.

                        <note place="margin">The Moralitie of human Acts.</note> which has the place of a firſt Principe in Ethics, we now paſſe on to the <hi>Moralitie of Human Acts,</hi> and their <hi>Bonitie.</hi> And here we ſhould firſt treat of the <hi>natural interne Principes of human Acts;</hi> namely <hi>the practic Judgement</hi> or <hi>Knowlege, Volition, Conſultation,</hi> and <hi>Election:</hi> But having diſcuſſed theſe more largely in <hi>Court of the Gentiles, P.</hi> 1. <hi>B.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. §. 24. we ſhal not here undertake the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of them. As for the <hi>Moralitie</hi> of human Acts, there are great diſputes in the Scholes, <hi>Wherein the</hi> Eſſe morale <hi>of human Acts doth conſiſte? Suarez,</hi> in 1.2. (which vulgarly they ſtile his Ethics) <hi>Tract.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 207. diſcourſeth largely of the Moralitie of human Acts under theſe heads. (1) He makes the formal denomination, or that forme whereby an Act is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated moral, to be more than an <hi>Ens rationis</hi> properly ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or a figment of mens minds, ſomething in or appendent to the things themſelves. This we grant. (2) He thence dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, That the <hi>Eſſe morale</hi> in the act of the Wil, beſides its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie and ſubſtance, addes a certain mode of emanation or moral
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42100:43"/>dependence on the Reaſon adverting, and the Wil freely work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This Hypotheſis needs animadverſion and reſtriction. It's true, the Moralitie of human Acts hath dependence on the Reaſon and Wil as the ſubject of thoſe Acts: for al moral Acts depend on the phyſic Principes of thoſe Acts: there is no moral Being but has its foundation in ſome phyſic or natural Being: As al moral capacitie is ſubjected in natural, ſo al moral Acts. Virtue flowing from God has its ſeat in the Creature, and ſo ſuppoſeth a create intelligent Nature as antecedent thereto. Thus <hi>Cyril A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandr. Compend. Dialog. de S. Trinit. Tom.</hi> 5. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 673. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>That which is holy by participation, being the receptacle of adventitious Sanctitie, that of it ſelf exiſtes primarily in proper nature: namely as Man and Angel, or any other rational Creature.</hi> So <hi>Damaſcene, Dialect. cap.</hi> 59. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>That is first by nature which is inferred, but infers not, i.e. ſecundùm exiſtendi conſequentiam:</hi> if there be Grace there muſt be human Nature wherein it is ſeated; but if there be human Nature, it doth not neceſſarily follow, that there muſt be Grace. Thus the human Underſtanding and Wil precede Virtue, as the ſubject thereof. Yet hence it follows not, as <hi>Suarez</hi> ſeems to conclude, that moral Acts receive their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal denomination from their relation to the Underſtanding and Wil. (3) Hence <hi>Suarez</hi> concludes, that the <hi>Eſſe morale</hi> is a mode not <hi>phyſically</hi> and <hi>intrinſecally</hi> inherent in the moral act; but in the externe act it ſpeaks denomination from the free act of the Wil: and in the very act of the Wil, beſides its phyſic emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Wil, it ſpeaks denomination from the reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, and the Wil acting with a plenarie power. Though, as it has been granted, al Moralitie of human Acts doth preſuppoſe the emanation of thoſe acts from the Underſtanding and Wil, as their main Principles; yet it follows not hence, that the formal reaſon of their Moralitie muſt be taken from this mode of ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. May we not as wel argue, that al virtuoſe acts are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſed by their relation to the natural Principes of human acts; becauſe they flow thence? But there lies a myſterie in this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitic Hypotheſis, which when laid open wil ſoon evidence its vanitie and falſhood. The Jeſuites, and ſome other Schole-men, in imitation, yet on miſtaken grounds, of the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42100:43"/>place the formal reaſon of al moral Virtue in conformitie to right Reaſon. Hence no wonder if they make al Moralitie, formally conſidered, to be a mode dependent on Reaſon and Wil. But the falſitie hereof wil appear by what follows.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the Moralitie of human Acts as ſtated by <hi>Plato,</hi> it cannot be denied but that he alſo makes mention of an <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>a right Reaſon,</hi> which he ſeems to make the meaſure of al <hi>Moralitie, Bonitie,</hi> and <hi>Vice.</hi> But what a vaſt diſtance there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Plato</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>right Reaſon,</hi> and that maintained by the Jeſuites and ſome other Schole-men, we ſhal, when we come to diſcourſe of <hi>moral Bonitie,</hi> ſufficiently evince. For the preſent we ſhal endeavor to determine the true nature of Moralitie, ſo much darkened by ſcholaſtic niceties, in the following Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. (1) Prop. <hi>Al Moralitie of human Acts ſpeaks ſome funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſubjective dependence on the natural Principes of human Acts.</hi> For there is nothing in Moralitie but has ſome relation to, yea dependence on human Nature as its ſubject and fundament. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie is but a mode or relation, which cannot ſubſiſt of it ſelf, without a ſubject and foundation in Nature. Can a man know and love God, without reaſon and wil? (2) Prop. <hi>The Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of human Acts is not formaliſed or ſpecified</hi> in genere moris <hi>by the relation ſuch Acts have to Reaſon or Wil.</hi> For every thing is ſpecified and formaliſed by its formal reaſon: and what is the formal reaſon of any thing but the Idea of its Eſſence? And wherein conſiſtes the eſſence of moral Acts, but in their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to, if good, or difformitie from, if bad, the perfect mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Morals? and what is the perfect meaſure of Morals, but the moral Law? (3) Prop. <hi>The Moralitie of human Acts is a real mode, not abſolute but relative, appendent to thoſe Acts.</hi> That Moralitie is not a mere figment of Reaſon, but ſomething real is generally confeſſed, and that on invincible grounds; becauſe it has real influences and effects. Moreover, that Moralitie is not an <hi>abſolute</hi> mode, but <hi>relative,</hi> is as evident; becauſe the whole of its eſſence ſpeaks a relation to ſomewhat elſe. Hence, (4) Prop. <hi>The Moralitie of human Acts ſpeaks ſome relation to the laſt end.</hi> For the laſt end in Morals hath the force of a firſt Principe, Forme, and Meaſure. It's a great Effate in the Scholes, <hi>That the End ſpecifies in Morals.</hi> Althings are defined and meaſured by their laſt End, but this by nothing. The laſt end, as a pregnant univerſal Principe, conteins al Morals in its wombe. (5) Prop.

                        <hi>The object mater doth alſo in ſome degree concur to the formaliſing of moral Acts.</hi> Thence, ſaith <hi>Aquinas, A moral Act receives its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from the object and end.</hi> And <hi>Petrus à Sancto Joſeph, Theſ.</hi> 165. addes, <q>That an Act is moral from the order it has to its object, not conſidered in its being but morally, as ſubject to the Rules of Moralitie.</q> To this of the object we may adde al eſſential moral circumſtances, which oft adde much to the being and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of Moralitie. (6) Prop. But yet we muſt conclude, <hi>That the adequate exemplar and perfect meaſure of al Moralitie, formally conſidered, is the Law of God:</hi> This comprehends and gives mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to al other Rules of Moralitie: the laſt end, object, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are al meaſured hereby. Thus <hi>Scotus,</hi> and other of the Schole-men determine, <hi>That the</hi> Eſſe morale, <hi>or Moralitie of an Act as ſuch is its relation to that Law, unto which it is referred.</hi> And the reaſon is moſt evident; becauſe al Moralitie ſpeaks a <gap reason="foreign">

But to bring <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophemes to ſacred Philoſophie, touching the conformitie of al moral Good to the divine Law, we ſhal determine the whole in the following Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>Al moral Bonitie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Moral Bonitie in conformitie to a Law.</note> 
                        <hi>whether objective or ſubjective and formal, denotes a conformitie to ſome Law.</hi> The Scholes diſtinguiſh moral Bonitie or Honeſtie into <hi>objective</hi> and <hi>formal.</hi> The former is that which conſtitutes a thing morally good as an object; but the later, that which conſtitutes an act as an act morally good. (1) In the objects of human Acts there is neceſſarily required a moral goodneſſe, which agrees thereto as objects, as <hi>Suarez</hi> 1.2. <hi>Tract.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 2. ſtrongly proves. And the reaſons are demonſtrative: For [1] If the object or mater be not morally good or lawful, the act converſant thereabout can never be good: becauſe al mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good requires an integritie of cauſes: an irregularitie in the object wil render the act irregular. [2] The object of the Wil is good as good: therefore that Bonitie which moves the Wil cannot ſlow from it, but muſt be ſuppoſed as inherent in or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent to its objects. [3] This moral goodneſſe of the object doth not only agree to human Acts, but alſo to al other things which may be lawfully loved and embraced. [4] This moral objective Bonitie ariſeth from the mater as clothed with al its conditions and circumſtances, whereby it is rendred a meet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the Soul to cloſe with. [5] The moral goodneſſe of any object conſiſtes in its conformitie to or agreament with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law. (2) There is alſo <hi>formal Bonitie</hi> or <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> which conſtitutes a man formally good. For [1] An object, though never ſo good, cannot conſtitute a man or his act formally good. It's
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42100:45"/>true the Act receives ſome goodneſſe from its object, yet only <hi>materially</hi> and <hi>terminatively,</hi> not <hi>formally,</hi> ſo as to conſtitute the Act formally good. [2] The Act is ſo far formally good as vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> proceding from right Principes, tending to a right end, and meaſured by a perfect Rule. Al which preſuppoſe ſome divine Law as the meaſure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">The Meaſure of Moral Good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> Prop. <hi>That Law, which is the meaſure of moral Bonitie, must be perfect.</hi> This Hypotheſis is moſt evident, and wil appear to be ſuch, if we conſider either the nature of a meaſure, or the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing meaſured. (1) As for the nature of a meaſure, <hi>Plato, Repub.</hi> 6. wel explicates the ſame: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>A defective mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſuch things is no meaſure; for that which is imperfect cannot be the meaſure of any thing.</hi> Every <hi>Meaſure</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> is indiviſible, and therefore capable neither of addition or ſubſtraction. Thus <hi>Phavorinus:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>A Canon or Rule is an infallible meaſure, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting neither addition nor detraction.</hi> And thus much indeed is formally included in the notion <hi>Canon:</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">

(2) That the meaſure of moral Bonitie muſt be perfect, is eaſily demonſtrated from the <hi>condition of moral Bonitie:</hi> for a plenitude of being, or integritie of Bonitie is eſſential to al moral good. Moral evil ariſeth from the leaſt defect, but moral good requireth an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of cauſes and parts. If there be the leaſt circumſtance miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed or miſtimed, it renders the act vitioſe. Now if al moral good muſt be thus perfect and entire, then it neceſſarily follows, that its meaſure and rule muſt be perfect and entire. But of this more in what follows.</p>

It was ſaid before, that al moral good requires an integritie of Being and Cauſes. In the Scholes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42100:45"/>they make four Cauſes of moral Good, proportionable to thoſe in natural productions, namely <hi>Mater, Forme, End, Efficient.</hi> We ſhal not at preſent think our ſelves obliged to examine or defend the legalitie of this diſtribution; but endeavor to demonſtrate, that a perfect meaſure of moral Bonitie comprehends each of theſe Cauſes and Principes. (1) It muſt comprehend the <hi>object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mater</hi> of al moral Bonitie in its fulleſt <hi>Amplitude, Extenſion,</hi> and <hi>

If there be any moral Dutie, which the Law of Moralitie extends not to, it is no perfect meaſure. And this argues the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Natures light in us, and al human Laws, as hereafter.

(2) But the Divine Eſſence being too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and diſtant from the Creature, he hath therefore given us a divine Law, as the Miroir and Idea of his eſſential Sanctitie, to be the rule of al moral Bonitie as to us.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42100:48"/>confines of its words? Doth not the great Legiſlator take the blackeſt ſins, as <hi>Murder, Adultery, Theft,</hi> &amp;c. and place them, as ſo many commun Heads, in the Decalogue, that ſo by theſe we may be inſtructed, how black and odioſe al thoſe other ſins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to thoſe heads, are? Wherefore to penetrate and dive into the nature and contents of the Ten Commandments, we muſt in a particular manner inquire (1) What in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is treated of, (2) The end for which it was given, (3) What therein is diſpleaſing or pleaſing to God. And after al we ſhal find, that the moral Law is <hi>ſpiritual, holy, juſt</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12, 14. reaching al the motions and diſpoſitions of the heart. And indeed how abſurd is it to conceit, that he, who made the heart, and knows al the diverticules, or turnings and windings of it, ſhould make a Law to reach only the outward acts, and not the inward principes and motions? May we not then conclude, that the Decalogue and moral Law of the ſupreme Legiſlator extends its Precepts to the whole Soul, and al its Principes, Powers, Inclinations, Thoughts, Affections, and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions interne and externe; directing the ſame to their right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and ends; affecting them with their inſeparable Accidents and Modifications; clothing them with their immutable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; in ſuch ſort, that the action good by this Law can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be made evil; that which is evil by this Law can never be made good; that which is good or evil by this Law can never be made indifferent?

This being the commun and received diſtribution, I am not ſcrupuloſe in following the ſame, yet ſo as not to exclude the two former diviſions.</p>

For in as much as it belongs to Reaſon to order al human Acts; if any Act be not ordered to its laſt end, it is ſo far evil: if it be ordered to its laſt end, it is then good, &amp;c.</q> Thus <hi>Gibieuf de Libertat. pag.</hi> 74. <q>We moſt evidently gather from the ſubordination of our Wil to its laſt end, that there are no human Acts indifferent <hi>in individuo;</hi> but al are good or evil: for it is not lawful for a rational Creature, ſo long as he is ſuch, not to returne that back to God which he received from God.</q> Again, <hi>p.</hi> 77. <q>Every thing ought to act according to its nature: and he that doth otherwiſe is deficient; becauſe nature is the meaſure of other things. If therefore man puts forth an human Act, he ought thereby to be converted towards God.</q> Indeed Indifference can no more be found in individual Acts, than it can be denied as to ſome Acts conſidered in their Species. Al Acts of Man in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence were good: al the Acts of man under the dominion of corrupt Nature are evil: al the Acts of man in Glorie ſhal be good: al the Acts of man under Grace are either good or evil: not one of al theſe indifferent. Were al our actions regulated by the Divine moral Law, they would be al good. Yea our very natural and civil Acts, as to their manner, ſo far as they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good or evil, are al regulated and determined by the moral Law. For albeit the Divine Law be not, as it ought not to be, a general ſum of Arts and Sciences; nor yet a particular <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie</hi> for the Government of States or Politic Acts; yet the particular determination of al our Acts fals under the Divine Law, ſo far as they are moral and Chriſtian; according to the nature of al Profeſſions and Sciences, coincident for the moſt part in the mater, but diſtinct in the manner of conſideration. Thus much <hi>Petrus à Sancto Joſeph,</hi> that late compilator of Schole-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 167. acknowledgeth: <q>There is not, ſaith he, any Act indifferent <hi>in individuo;</hi> but every ſuch Act, if it procede from ſufficient deliberation, is either good or evil, although not as to its object, yet in regard of its circumſtances.</q> The
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42100:51"/>ſcratching of the head, or the taking up of a ſtraw, is either good or evil. This ſeems a Paradoxe to ſome that are ignorant, and diſguſtful to Libertines, who would be ſo; yet generally granted by Philoſophers and Divines, yea ſcarce ever profeſſedly denied by any, ſave ſome ſew, who diſtinguiſh between Acts proceding from mere Imagination, and ſuch as are deliberate.

When therefore a moral operation is not conforme to right Reaſon, [or the Law] ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to al due circumſtances, it is vitioſe and morally evil.</q> This his Hypotheſis he proves by two Concluſions. 1. Concluſ. <hi>That no moral Act wanting any one due Circumstance, is truly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſe.</hi> This he proves by ſhewing that the contrary implies a contradiction. For if a moral Act want any one due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it is not as it ought to be: therefore it is evil. Due circumſtances are communly ſaid to be ſuch things, as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to this, that the Act be truly virtuoſe: and if an Act be truly virtuoſe it is conforme to right Reaſon, or the moral Law: and if ſuch, then it wants not any due circumſtance: wherefore if any Act wanting a due circumſtance ſhould be truly virtuoſe, it wil then neceſſarily follow, <hi>That it doth want, and yet that it doth not want a due circumſtance:</hi> or, <hi>That it is truly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſe, and yet that it is not truly virtuoſe.</hi> 2. Concluſ. <hi>That every ſuch Act as wants its due Circumſtances is morally evil and ſin.</hi> It is evil becauſe it wants its due bonitie or goodneſſe, namely its due circumſtance. For ſin is nothing elſe but the want of a due good, or voluntarily to act againſt the Divine Law. Thus much alſo <hi>Suarez</hi> grants us, <hi>That ſome conditions that are only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and accidental to an Act</hi> in eſſe rei, <hi>as to the phyſic being, are yet eſſential</hi> in eſſe moris, <hi>as to its moral being.</hi> So <hi>Suarez,</hi> 1.2. <hi>Tract.</hi> 2. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 169. <q>The firſt opinion, ſaith he, is, That an human Act may be conſidered in its <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral</hi> being: and that circumſtances are ſo called in relation to the natural, not the moral being of the Act; but that al theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are ſubſtantial Principes or proper Cauſes of the moral action as ſuch.</q> He mentions this as the opinion of ſome Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, namely, that there are no accidental circumſtances of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42100:54"/>Acts morally conſidered; but that al theſe Circumſtances are eſſential and properly influential on the ſaid moral Acts. Which indeed is a great truth, whereunto, though not fully, yet thus far he aſſents: <q>It is true, ſaith he, what the firſt opinion aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, <hi>That ſome conditions may be accidental to the act,</hi> in eſſe rei, <hi>as a natural act, and yet eſſential to it,</hi> in eſſe moris, <hi>morally conſidered.</hi> And the reaſon, addes he, is taken <hi>à priori,</hi> becauſe the <hi>eſſe morale</hi> or <hi>moral being</hi> of an Act primarily dependes on the order of Reaſon; (we ſay of the Law:) but now it oft happens, that an act or object hath a diverſe order to reaſon, by reaſon of diverſe conditions of thoſe things that concur to the moral Act.</q> Thence <hi>pag.</hi> 174. he tels us what Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are eſſential. <q>
                           <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> (which muſt be underſtood objectively) is the rule of human acts and their circumſtances: therefore the affection or reaſon of theſe Circumſtances cannot be better explicated, than by their order or regard to right Reaſon, (I would ſay the Divine Law.) And the ſame rule is to be uſed for the underſtanding when the conditions of moral Acts are not properly Circumſtances, but eſſential, namely when they are ſuch as, according to right Reaſon, are altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not only as to degrees, but ſimply as to the honeſtie or turpitude of the act. For when a Circumſtance altogether changeth the conformitie or difformitie of an human act, it changeth its Species.</q> In which he plainly grants, <hi>That al thoſe Circumstances which change the conformitie or difformitie of an human act, are ſpecific and eſſential:</hi> Which is al that we need contend for; becauſe the Controverſie is not about <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>civil</hi> Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but ſuch as belong to the act <hi>morally</hi> conſidered: which if good requireth an integritie of Cauſes and plenitude of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: ſo that if one Circumſtance due to the moral bonitie of the act be defective, the whole act is changed and rendred mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally evil. By the whole of which it is moſt evident, that al Circumſtances due to the moral goodneſſe of an human act, are eſſential and ſpecific, ſuch as concur to formaliſe moral Good; which requires a complete conformitie to the Divine Law, not only in <hi>Mater, Principes,</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> but alſo in al <hi>Circumstances</hi> morally due to the integritie of ſuch an Act: <hi>For al good</hi> (as has been ſufficiently demonſtrated) <hi>requires an integritie of Cauſes; whereas ſin ariſeth from the leaſt defect:</hi> according to that knowen Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fate of the ſpurious <hi>Dionyſius, Divin.

Al habits are as a Pondus affixed to the Soul, whereby it is ſtrongly bent and inclined towards objects, ends and acts, ſuitable thereto. Al habitual Vertues are one and the ſame in regard of principe and ſeed, though different as to their proper objects and acts. The ſame habitual Entitie as it facilitates to know God, is called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowlege; but as it facilitates to love God, it's called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love; and ſo in the other virtuoſe Habits.

What Natural Libertie is, has been fully explicated <hi>Court Gent. P.</hi> 2. <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. §. 11. How much moral Libertie differs from natural may eaſily be diſcerned by any that impartially conſiders the ſame. The later indeed is eſſential to and inſeparable from man as man, and al human acts; but the former is proper to man as virtuoſe, as wil ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appear by what follows. Every man is ſo far morally free as he is near to God. Althings aim at Unitie: God, who is the ſupreme Unitie, convertes althings to himſelf: and every thing is ſo far free and perfect, as it comes near to God. The human Soul has a twofold approche to God, (1) by <hi>Similitude,</hi> (2) by <hi>actual real <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Fruition.</hi> (1) The more like the Soul is to God, the more one it is with him, and free: al ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is a kind of Unitie: and whence ſprings the Souls ſimilitude to God, but from virtuoſe habits? (2) The Soul has actual real union with, and fruition of God by virtuoſe exercices. Hence ariſeth a twofold moral Libertie: (1) <hi>As to State,</hi> (2) <hi>As to Exercice</hi> in that ſtate. The former depends on habitual Virtue; the later on virtuoſe exercices. Of each in their order.</p>

By how much the more ample, ſpiritual, pure, and perfect the Soul is, by ſo much the more free it is: and whence ſprings the Amplitude, Spiritualitie, Puritie, and Perfection of the Soul, but from virtuoſe habits?

For wherein conſiſtes the perfection of moral Libertie, but in its conformitie to its moſt perfect Exemplar, which is the Divine Bonitie? And is not this the privilege of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bonitie or Virtue? Hence Virtue is defined by <hi>Aquinas, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio perfecti ad optimum, The Diſpoſition of a perfect Subject, to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42100:60"/>the moſt perfect Exemplar and End.</hi> Virtue indeed is more perfect than the Soul it ſelf: ſo <hi>Aquinas:</hi> 
                        <q>Grace, ſaith he, in it ſelf and according to its eſſence, is more noble than the nature of the Soul; becauſe it is an expreſſion or participation of the divine Bonitie: and that which is ſubſtantially in God, is accidentally in the Soul participating of the divine Bonitie.

In ſum, Libertie of ſtate conſiſtes in a virtuoſe or gracioſe diſpoſition of Soul, whereby it is enabled to underſtand, embrace and adhere to what is good, in that manner and meaſure as it ought.

By how much the more ſpiritual and pure any facultie is, by ſo much the ſtronger it is: and is not Virtue the puritie of the Soul? Again, the ſtrength of every thing conſiſtes in its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence to its firſt Principes, and laſt end: departure from our firſt Principe and laſt end ſpeaks impotence: And what is it that enables us to adhere to our firſt Principe and laſt end but Virtue?

The firſt moſt ample Being is God, who has no limits to his Being, or his Felicitie: and ſo far as man is like to God, ſo far he enters into this Divine Amplitude of ſtate. Hence the Platoniſts aſſert, that Amplitude is founded in Unitie, namely God, and from this divine Unitie it takes its origine and meaſures. For every thing is by ſo much the more <hi>ample</hi> and <hi>extenſive,</hi> by how much the nearer it comes to <hi>pure Act.</hi> Al mater and paſſive power brings with it limits and coarctation: every thing is ſo far ſtraitned and narrowed in its being and appetite, as it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of mater either <hi>phyſic</hi> or <hi>metaphyſic:</hi> but on the contrary, ſo far as things approche unto <hi>pure Act,</hi> which is God, ſo far they rejoice in Amplitude and Enlargement, either of Being or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: and who approche nearer unto God, who is <hi>pure Act,</hi> than virtuoſe Souls, who partake of the Divine ſimilitude? Do not theſe then partake moſt of divine Amplitude as to ſtate? How miſerably is the Soul <hi>ſtraitned, pinioned,</hi> and <hi>cooped</hi> up by ſin? But O1 what a boundleſſe moral Amplitude do virtuoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits bring with them? Subjection and Adheſion to God by Virtue
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42100:61"/>brings the higheſt Amplitude and Dominion. For God being the <hi>first Efficient,</hi> that gives Being, and the <hi>last End,</hi> that gives bleſſed Being; it hence neceſſarily follows, that Subjection and Adheſion to God, in both theſe reſpects, muſt bring the higheſt Amplitude and Dominion with it. As man, by departure from God, is ſubject to a miſerable neceſſitie, and coarctation of ſin; ſo by regreſſe and returne to God he paſſeth into Divine Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Is not the Aſſimilation of the Soul to God by virtuoſe habits, its ultimate perfection as to ſtate? Muſt not then al di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Amplitude take its origine hence?

In ſhort then, the nearer and more like to God the Soul is, the more ample and capacious it is: and by how much the more virtuoſe it is, by ſo much the nearer, and more like to God it is: doth it not then neceſſarily follow, that according to the degree and meaſure of Virtue, ſuch is the degree and meaſure of divine Amplitude as to ſtate?

                        <hi>Plato</hi> makes Beautie to ariſe from the predominance of the forme over the mater, which otherwiſe is diſtorme. By the forme I underſtand the ſpirituoſe active Principe; and ſo indeed it holds true of the Soul, the Beautie whereof conſiſtes in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominance of virtuoſe habits, which are as the ſpirits, and forme of the Soul. For look as the Soul, which is the forme of a man, gives life, vigor, perfection and beautie to the human bodie; ſo proportionably virtuoſe habits give life, vigor, perfection and beautie to the human Soul. <hi>Plato</hi> abounds much in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Virtue is the Beautie of the Soul.

That the contemplation of the firſt Being is one of the higheſt Acts of moral Libertie is moſt manifeſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (1) Contemplation is the higheſt Act of the Soul; and therefore when placed on the ſupreme Being and higheſt Object, muſt needs bring the higheſt Libertie and Perfection with it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3.

(5) Contemplation of the firſt Beautie is moſt influential on the divine Life, and therefore a main Spring of Moral Libertie. Is not this a great Source of Divine Wiſdome?

For ſuch as a mans laſt end is, ſuch is the motion of his Soul as to moral good or evil, and moral libertie or bondage. By how much the more we love, delight in and enjoy our laſt end, by ſo much the more free we are in al our ways. The libertie of a rational Agent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtes, not in having varietie of objects to adhere to, and take complacence in, but in tranſmitting al to his laſt end, which is his beſt good.</p>
                     <p>That a Wil actually and ſtrongly bended to adhere to its laſt End and chiefeſt Good is moſt free, wil appear by the following Particulars. (1) The more the Wil is fortified by true Virtue to adhere to its laſt End and chiefeſt Good, the more free it is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42100:66"/>from ſin, which is the worſt ſervitude. He indeed is truly noble and generoſe, who is not a vaſſal to any baſe luſt. Al power to ſin is the diminution of libertie. Impeccabilitie or an utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie of ſinning is ſo far from deſtroying libertie, as that it is perfected hereby.

Where there is a ſubordination of Cauſes, either moral or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it is the libertie of the inferior to depend on, and receive from the ſuperior. Doth not the firſt Cauſe give forth actual aſſiſtances uſually according to the meaſure of our actual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on him? If he drop not in every moment new ſpirits and influences, how ſoon do al moral Virtues wither and die away? What more natural than for the ſecond cauſe to depend on the firſt?

As the excellence of the Angelic nature could not preſerve them, when ſelf-dependent; ſo the impotence of Human nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prejudice us, ſo long as we are dependent on the firſt Cauſe. True moral Virtue is a celeſtial Plant, fed by ſome inviſible root in the celeſtial World; from which it derives its influences.

We cannot active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw down divine influences, but we may enlarge our paſſive receptive capacitie by actual dependence thereon. Al moral Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, even the Angels themſelves, as they have new ſervices to do for God daily, ſo they are dependent for new aſſiſtances; and herein conſiſtes a main part of their moral Libertie.

The Apoſtle brings this as an argument to prove, that our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Libertie doth not lie ſimply in the uſe of theſe things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when we are moſt free, there wil be no uſe of them. God gives not men libertie to enjoy what they liſt, but what they ought: the free uſe of Creatures conſiſtes in this, to make us more free inthe ſervice of God: herein lies the goodneſſe of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in our being thereby enabled to do good.

                     <p>That to ſerve God is the higheſt Libertie that human Nature is capable of, ſacred Philoſophie doth abundantly aſſure us.

Yet over an above this God rewards every degree of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicer with ſome degree of libertie, tranquillitie and peace.

(1) <hi>Al moral Evil or Sin is founded in ſome natural Good.</hi> For albeit there be <hi>pure good,</hi> which has no mixture of evil, either <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral,</hi> as the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Good; yet there is no <hi>pure Evil,</hi> which has not for its ſubject ſome natural good. It's true there are ſome Acts that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally evil, that is, ſo far evil, as that they can never be good: <hi>as the hatred of God,</hi> and the like. Yet theſe Acts are called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally evil, not as if their evil were intrinſecal to the natural entitie of the acts; for it's poſſible that the evil may be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the acts; but becauſe they cannot be put forth towards ſuch an object morally conſidered without ſin. (2) Al Sin is <hi>an aggregate compoſite Being, compoſed of poſitive and privative.</hi> The <hi>material Subject</hi> or natural Act is <hi>poſitive;</hi> but the <hi>formal Reaſon,</hi> or moral deficience of Rectitude is <hi>privative.</hi> The poſitive Act of it ſelf, abſtracted from the privation, is not ſinful; but both together, as <hi>mater</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> make up one Compoſitum. It's a Queſtion in the Scholes, <hi>Whether Sin thus compounded of privative and poſitive</hi> be <hi>unum per ſe,</hi> or <hi>per accidens?</hi> And <hi>Suarez</hi> wel ſolves this difficultie, telling us, <q>That if we conſider ſin as a phyſical real Being, it is <hi>unum per accidens;</hi> but if we conſider it as a <hi>moral Being,</hi> ſo it is <hi>unum per ſe;</hi> becauſe the <hi>poſitive act</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative deficience,</hi> are ſo intimately conjoined for the conſtitution of one moral Evil, that they may be looked on under the notion of act and power, or mater and forme; ſo that the act cannot be evil without the privation; nor the privation without the act.</q> (3) <hi>Every Privation as ſuch is evil, as every Forme or Act good.</hi> For what is a privation but the want of ſome due perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And is not every want of due perfection evil to that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that wants it? Every thing, if it want any good that belongs to it, is ſo far evil. (4) <hi>When we ſay the formal reaſon of Sin is privative, the terme</hi> formal <hi>must not be taken ſtrictly, but in a laxe notion, and morally.</hi> For the <gap reason="foreign">

                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:42100:76"/>doth morally conſtitute the act ſinful, it may in a more laxe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be rightly termed the <hi>formal Reaſon</hi> or Cauſe. (5) <hi>Sin, as to its formal reaſon, is not a Phyſic or Logic privation, nor yet pure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but a moral privation, or deficience as to moral rectitude.</hi> In this reſpect ſome Divines aſcribe to ſin ſomething <hi>poſitive,</hi> not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as if it were ſomewhat ſubſiſtent, but <hi>relatively</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> as it is oppoſed to <hi>pure nothing:</hi> for, ſay they, ſin is a <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which makes the act whereto it belongs ſinful; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not mere nothing.

                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:42100:77"/>of the human Creature, as the original cauſe of al ſin. For, to ſpeak in the Platonic mode, Man, as al other Creatures, being compoſed of <hi>ſomething and nothing,</hi> yea more of <hi>nothing</hi> than <hi>ſomething;</hi> hence <hi>paſſive power</hi> and defectibilitie is eſſential to his Being. For whatever ſprang out of nothing is capable of returning to its originary nothing. Where there is place for <hi>Proficience,</hi> there alſo remains a capacitie of <hi>Deficience.</hi> Every Creature, becauſe made by God, is capable of <hi>Proficience;</hi> but becauſe made out of nothing, it is alſo capable of <hi>Deficience.</hi> It's true, Man, as made by God, was void of al moral deficience or ſin; yet as Man, he was never void of <hi>Defectibilitie</hi> and <hi>Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie:</hi> he had a moral free-wil for good; but a natural free-wil or defectibilitie as to ſin: which paſſing from power into act gave being to the firſt ſin.

                        <q>In a free Agent, ſaith he, the mode of failing in an act, ariſeth from the dominion he has over his act: hence ſin in a free cauſe doth not always ſuppoſe the like ſin in the ſame cauſe: for it may ariſe merely from the libertie of the Creature, which is good.</q> That the Wil of <hi>Adam,</hi> in his innocent ſtate, was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſinning, was a natural defect, conjoined with a natural perfection: for it was alſo capable not to ſin: and this mutable capacitie being drawen forth towards a prohibited object, was the firſt origine and root of al ſin. Thus moral Evil ſprang out of natural libertie in it ſelf good, but evilly applied.</p>

                     <p>Yet it cannot be denied, but that many of the ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Schole-men have given us great notices of this natural Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſitie, ſpecially ſuch as were Sectators of <hi>Augustine,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas, Ariminenſis, Bradwardine, Alvarez,</hi> &amp;c. We may reduce the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the whole to the following Propoſitions. (1) <hi>Adams perſonal actual Sin becomes the natural original Sin of al his Posteritie.</hi> This the Gentile Philoſophers were ignorant of: they had ſome notices of the corruption of nature, but were ignorant of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie cauſe and manner of its traduction, as <hi>Augustine</hi> hath wel obſerved.<note place="margin">Iſte Tullius rem vidit, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam neſcivit. <hi>August.</hi> Peccatum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troivit non per modum imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis, ſed per modum origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> This Traduction of original Sin from <hi>Adam</hi> to his poſteritie is wel demonſtrated by <hi>Aquinas, contra Gentiles, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 50. where he demonſtrates, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 19. againſt the Pelagians, <q>That this original Sin infects al Mankind, not only in a way of imitation, which the Pelagians grant, but by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and traduction.</q> And <hi>Cap.</hi> 52. he farther explicates, how <hi>Adams</hi> perſonal, actual Sin, by imputation becomes our original and natural ſin. This original Sin is termed <hi>natural;</hi> becauſe congenite with, proper to, and inſeparable from corrupt nature, as to any power of its own. It conſiſtes formally in the privation of original Righteoùſneſſe: which privation is both our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſin: as original Righteouſneſſe, upon the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, is by divine Juſtice denied to us; ſo this privation is our puniſhment: but as it ought to be in us, and is wanting, by reaſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin become ours, ſo it is our ſin. (2) <hi>The Vitioſitie of Nature or original Sin is ſaid to be voluntary as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres in the Wil, and corrupts the ſame. Aristotle</hi> tels us, <hi>Acts are voluntary, becauſe they paſſe from the Wil; but habits, becauſe they are received into the Wil, and impreſſed thereon.</hi> Such is original Sin as to its Vitioſitie, which is as an habitual Pondus impacted on the Wil, and inclining it to al manner of vitioſe acts. Others make original Sin to be voluntary, with reſpect to the commun repreſentative Wil of our firſt Parent, whoſe Wil, as he was a commun Head, <hi>politically</hi> included ours. So <hi>Davenant,</hi> and the Schole-men. (3) <hi>The Vitioſitie of corrupt Nature is ſeminal, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical and univerſal both extenſively and intenſively.</hi> As every man <hi>naturally</hi> conſidered is a <hi>Microcoſme</hi> or little abridgement of the greater World; ſo <hi>morally</hi> conſidered, he is a <hi>Macrocoſme</hi> or a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42100:78"/>great World of corruption. Yea, al that is of contagion in the greater World comes from the ſuperfluitie of Vitioſitie ſhut up in the heart of man. If corrupt human Nature were not on the earth, there would be nothing in the World but what was good. Yea farther, there is more of Vitioſitie in one corrupt Nature, than a world of Sinners can vent. Every man hath ſin enough in his own nature to defile the whole Creation. And this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature is ſo deep, that al the fire in the World, yea of Hel, wil not fetch it out. It is univerſal both as to extenſion of parts and degrees. The man is infected with it from top to toe: it poiſons his eye, ear, tongue, hand and every part: it dogs him from place to place. This Plague of corrupt Nature is greater in ſome than in others, and uſually greateſt in thoſe of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Al ſins in the heart do not act alike at al times; yet al are there in the ſeed and root of corrupt nature. Many luſts worke indirectly as Principes that lie low: men act in the power of them, and yet obſerve them not. (4) <hi>This univerſal Vitioſitie of corrupt Nature is the ſoverain reigning Sin, which breeds, foments, and influenceth al other Sins. Adams</hi> perſon firſt corrupted our Nature; and human Nature being corrupted, corrupts our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and our perſons being corrupted, corrupt al our actions, and thereby encreaſe the corruption of our Natures. It is a great Queſtion in practic Theologie, <hi>What is a mans reigning Sin?</hi> But if we conſider reigning ſin ſimply and abſolutely, it is no other than corrupt nature. It's true, there are in particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, according to their particular inclinations, tentations, and circumſtances, particular ſins that bear ſway and rule: but theſe are but as <hi>Viceroys</hi> and Vicegerents under the vitioſitie of corrupt nature; which is the ſupreme Soverain and Lord, as a cruel beſte nouriſhed in our bowels, ever ready to devour us. The main part of our enmitie againſt God, and his enmitie againſt us lies in the vitioſitie of our natures, and its contrarietie to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6.</p>

Indeed the power of ſin lies in the power of darkneſſe or ignorance: practic Errors foment and maintain luſts. The mind, like a ſilk-worme, lies intangled in thoſe errors, that came out of its own bowels: when luſt hath put out Reaſon, it ſoon takes the Chair: men of corrupt minds, are men of ſinful lives: Mind and Wil do reciprocally vitiate each other: whiles luſt bribes conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence out of office, it cooperates with ſin. Divine light is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to a corrupt conſcience; which delights to ſpin out of it ſelf ſick dreaming errors, thereby to create its own chains and fetters: a carnal mind vainly puffed up out-reaſons al good convictious of dutie: ſurely there is no dutie done by that man, whoſe conſcience doth not its dutie: for there is nothing in man active for God, when conſcience is not firſt active.

(2) <hi>There is an Ignorance of Right or Law:</hi> when men are ignorant of their dutie, which they ought
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42100:80"/>to know. (3) <hi>There is an ignorance from our own neglect:</hi> which had we been diligent in the uſe of means we might have avoided. (4) <hi>There is an ignorance from depraved affections and cuſtome in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may reduce theſe Philoſophemes of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to this more formal diſtribution. Man is directed in his action by a twofold knowlege, the one <hi>univerſal,</hi> the other <hi>particular:</hi> a defect in either of theſe cauſeth ſin. Whence it follows, that a man may have an univerſal knowlege, that this or that is ſinful in general, and yet want a particular judgement of its ſinfulneſſe in this or that caſe. So that particular ignorance is very wel conſiſtent with univerſal knowlege. But now, ſithat univerſal knowlege, though moſt certain, is not ſo influential on our actions, as particular; becauſe actions are about ſingulars; hence it follows, that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ignorance has more force to lead men into ſin, than univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal knowlege has to prevent it. This particular ignorance may be again diſtributed into <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>voluntary:</hi> and voluntary may be again divided into that which is <hi>antecedent,</hi> or that which is <hi>conſequent</hi> to the act. Yea al ignorance which ariſeth from the Wil, may be looked on as voluntary. For what is involuntary, if it ariſe from ſome precedent voluntary act, it may be judged voluntary, according to moral eſtimation. As in that inſtance which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives of a Drunkard, whoſe ignorance is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; becauſe ariſing from the act of his own Wil. For it is a good Rule of <hi>Ariſtotle, That thoſe Acts whoſe Principe is in us, may be ſaid to be ours and voluntarily undertaken by us.</hi> Laſtly we may, with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> diſtinguiſh between ſins which are <hi>per ignorantiam, i. e.</hi> when ignorance is the cauſe of the ſin: and ſuch as are <hi>cum ignorantia: i. e.</hi> when albeit ignorance attends the ſin, yet the proper cauſe of that ignorance lies in the ſinners wil: The former are thoſe which we cal ſins of ignorance, but the later not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ignorance is voluntary. Men want not ſo much means of knowing what they ought to do, as wil to do what they know. Reaſon may rightly diſcerne the thing which is good, and yet the wil of man not incline it ſelf thereto, as oft as ſenſual paſſions, prejudice, or affected ignorance prevail. So that ſome practic error or inconſideration lies at the root of every ſin: either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men do not practically conſider al circumſtances; or if they do conſider them, yet they do not practically determine <hi>this or that Act to be evil;</hi> but inſtead thereof they foiſt in another falſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42100:80"/>Concluſion, <hi>That this or that ſinful Act is ſweet, or profitable.</hi> A corrupt Conſcience may aſſent to good premiſes, and yet diſſent from the concluſion, yea conſent to a bad concluſion. Luſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Conſcience, and ſil it with partialitie and prejudice in its inquiries. The light of a carnal mind is eaſily reconciled with luſt: for a ſecure Conſcience takes up ſuch a Religion as wil not diſtaſte its luſts; nor yet its luſts moleſt it. There is a peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the luſt and light of a carnal heart: It's eaſie for a ſecure Conſcience to caſt light into priſon, and detain the truth of God in unrighteouſneſſe: to believe as it liſt, not as it ought. A corrupt Conſcience hath many turnings and windings, various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts and hiding places for luſt: Sometimes the veil of hypocriſie, yea of Religion is made uſe of to cover ſin, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a good name is put on a bad thing, or a bad deſigne is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a good end: or a good cauſe is made uſe of to juſtifie a bad action: or when mens luſts wil not comply with the rule, men bring down the rule to their luſts. Again, ſometimes new lights are pleaded to maintain old errors: Mens luſts make many controverſies about ſin: they make great ſins little, and little none at al.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42100:81"/>acts a! for himſelf, according to his profit.</hi> Every ſelf-lover is chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that great Idol Self, which he makes his God, and the only Centre, in which al the lines of his Affections and Actions meet. Self is the laſt end of ſelf-lovers, even in their higheſt acts of ſelf-denial: if they give their goods to the poor, or their bodies to be burned for Religion, it is al to pleaſe ſelf. They may croſſe their own wils, but never croſſe ſelf as their laſt end: if they ſeek after God, it is to advance ſelf: ſelf-love formes al their actions and paſſions into a ſubſervience unto ſome carnal ſelf-intereſt. What makes ſuperſtitioſe perſons ſo much to vilifie, mortifie, and with ſo much ſeveritie torment their bodies, but thereby to exalt their inward excellences? And as ſelf-lovers make ſelf the <hi>laſt End,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>first Principe</hi> of al they do. Self-love ever affects ſelf-dependence: it would fain have a World of its own to live, act, and breathe in: it lays the whole weight of religioſe ſervices on ſelf as the bottome of its dependence: it would live and die within the ſphere of its own activitie, as wel as intereſt. It's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſweet to ſelf to have a ſtock of its own even in things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioſe to trade with, and thereby merit divine favor. And alas! how ſoon are men overcome by tentations, when they are ſelf-dependent and ſelf-ſtrong? He that thinkes to keep himſelf from ſin by ſelf-ſtrength, wil ſoon be overcome by it. Now <hi>Self</hi> being the <hi>laſt End</hi> and <hi>first Principe</hi> of ſelf-love, it hence becomes a ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic univerſal cauſe of al ſin. Every ſelf-lover is his own Idol: and whiles he inordinately embraces and adheres to himſelf, he is ſoon overcome thereby, and ſo hurried into ſin. Yea ſelf-love makes the beſt duties and ſervices for God moſt carnal, vile, and abominable to God. Where ſelf is predominant, the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul is ſpurious and rotten: and a bad intention makes the beſt workes bad. Where ſelf rules, it formes even religioſe ſervices into a conformitie to carnal luſts: wherefore he that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depart from ſelf, wil ſoon depart from God, and tumble head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into al ſin. Self-love is the ſtrongeſt carnal concupiſcence, and moſt directly oppoſite to divine love. The ſoverain power of Luſt increaſeth according to the obedience men render to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and ſelf-love: by obeying ſelf and its particular movements men make it a God: yea, the more men endeavor to humor and gratifie it, the more tyrannie it is. Man has not a worſe or more dangerous Companion than himſelf, his carnal ſelf, which is ſo potent to draw him into ſin. It has always been the ambition of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42100:81"/>the Creature to deifie it ſelf, not by being equal in nature with God, but by being its firſt Cauſe and laſt End, which is the ſpring of al departure from God, and converſion to the Creature. And that which makes ſelf-love more potent to promote ſin is its poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and many artifices to concele its ſelf and ſin. How oft doth carnal ſelf-love put on the maſque of true lawful ſelf-love, and thereby delude the Soul into ſin? There is a great reſſemblance between ſpiritual ſelf-love and carnal: whence the later oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celes it ſelf under the vizard of the former. The more a man loves himſelf, the leſſe he conceits he loves himſelf: as the more mad a man is, the leſſe he judgeth himſelf ſo. Self-love is ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in its colors, as that it can diſcolor virtue with the face of vice, and vice with virtues face. Thus by its fraudes and deceits in conceling it ſelf and ſin, it greatly advances ſin. The members of ſelf-love are principally three. (1) <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> or <hi>adherence to the Creature as our laſt end.</hi> (2) <hi>Carnal confidence,</hi> or <hi>dependence on ſelf as the first cauſe.</hi> (3) <hi>Spiritual pride,</hi> or <hi>an over-valuing eſtime of ſelf-excellences.</hi> Each of theſe have a venimous influence on al ſin, as we have largely demonſtrated out of <hi>Plato</hi> and others, <hi>Philoſ.

                        <note place="margin">Sins are either of Ignorance, of Paſſion, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> or <hi>voluntary:</hi> again <hi>involuntary,</hi> into ſins of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or of <hi>Paſſion.</hi> We find the foundation of this diſtribution in <hi>Plato, Phileb. pag.</hi> 22. where he ſaith, <hi>That thoſe who chooſe ſin, do it either involuntarily and ignorantly, or out of a voluntary miſerable neceſſitie.</hi> 1. As for <hi>involuntary Sins,</hi> they are, (1) <hi>Sins of Ignorance,</hi> when the ignorance is not affected, either from prejudice, voluntary ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, or cuſtome in ſin, as before, §. 3. (2) <hi>Sins of Paſſion</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,</hi> when the paſſion is antecedent to the wil, and doth as it were extort the conſent of the wil, being vehement and violent. For if the paſſion be conſequent to the act of the wil, or but a languid remiſſe motion, ſuch as doth not force the wil, the ſin is not ſo much of paſſion, as voluntary: whence paſſions that ariſe from evil cuſtomes, and follow the wil, do not conſtitute a ſin of paſſion. Thence <hi>Ariſtotle. Eth. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. ſaith, <hi>That every ſin from paſſion is not involuntary.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Suarez,</hi> 1.2. <hi>Tract.</hi> 5. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 395. Now involuntarineſſe, in ſins either of ignorance or of paſſion, takes away ſomething of their aggravation: where there is real unaffected ignorance, paſſion or perturbation, there is leſſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42100:82"/>of ſin. Where there is <hi>involuntary Ignorance,</hi> there is want of that which might help the underſtanding: where antecedent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary paſſions hurrie men into ſin, there is voluntary diſſent or ſubſequent repentance. Hence the Diſciples of <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> ſaid, <hi>That they who ſin from perturbation, not voluntarily, deſerve pardon,</hi> as <hi>Laertius.</hi> 2. <hi>Voluntary wilful Sins,</hi> are ſuch as procede from a ſtrong bent of wil, without ignorance or paſſion as the original cauſe thereof. Such ſins are of greater aggravation, becauſe of leſſe provocation, and excuſe. From a perſeverance in voluntary ſins, and frequent repetition thereof procedes a fixed cuſtome and rooted habit of ſin, touching which we find many good Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes in <hi>Plato,</hi> of which hereafter §. 7. of the <hi>neceſſary ſervitude of Sin.</hi>

That al moral Evil or Sin is attended with the higheſt <hi>moral Servitude</hi> is evident from ſacred Philoſophie, as alſo the Philoſophemes of <hi>Plato</hi> and others.

A ſinner addicted to any baſe tyrannic Idol he luſts after, doth not poſſeſſe that beloved Idol, but that poſſeſſeth him, and brings him under a miſerable Tyrannie, ſo that he can neither part with, nor enjoy what he luſts after: and by how the more the Idols he luſts after are multiplied, by ſo much the leſſe power has he over himſelf, or the things which he poſſeſſeth. And the ſoverain power and tyrannie of ſin appears in nothing more than in this, that men do voluntarily obey its dicates and commands. Such whoſe hearts are chained to any inferior Idol, have no power over themſelves: they are not their own: they have no dominion over their own perſons, actions, objects of uſe or fruition, in moral eſtimation. There is nothing that human Nature more abhors, than to be under the Tyrannie of others; and yet al ſinners electively embrace a ſelf-tyrannie, to be under the power of tyrannic luſts.</p>

And if the perſon be dead, can his acts or workes be alive? May we expect a good thought, or word, or deed from ſuch al their days, ſo long as they continue in ſuch a dead ſtate of ſin? Is it poſſible for a dead corps to take up its coffin, and grave upon its back, and thence to ariſe and

It is frequently inculcated in ſacred Philoſophie, That there are no ſeeds of ſpiritual life in corrupt nature. A human power is not ſufficient to produce an act more than human. The divine life and motion towards God muſt procede from God. Mans ſin and miſerie come from his own free-wil, but al Virtue and Beatitude from free Grace: he that is not acted by divine Grace, is neceſſarily acted by carnal luſt: corrupt nature is not only emty of, but contrary to al good; and therefore al workes done by it are dead workes; becauſe they procede from a dead nature, and tend to death: wherefore true moral Virtue cannot be extracted out of the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Corrupt nature wants not only an active power to do good, but alſo an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate paſſive power to receive good: thence it can't diſpoſe it ſelf to virtue, which is above its natural capacitie.

The Aſſertion of ſuch a moral Free-wil in lapſed Nature doth (1) <hi>raiſe up the human cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Wil to the condition of God, and is the Nurſe of al Sin.</hi> It feeds mens pride and affectation of a Deitie, vain-glorie, carnal confidence, ſecuritie, Atheiſme, unbelief, ingratitude.

(2) <hi>It puls down God from his Throne of Grace, and reduceth him to the condition of a Creature.</hi> [1] It ſtrikes at the very Being of God, making him to be dependent on, and moved by the human Wil.

[5] It abandons and baniſheth out of the world al ſupernatural efficacious Grace: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting no Grace but what wil ſtoop and ſubmit to the dominion of the human Wil, and its ſoverain Empire. [6] It is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly injurioſe to Chriſt, and al his mediatorie Offices. It ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertes his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Office, by laying a foundation for human Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, &amp;c. It ſtrikes at his <hi>Prophetic</hi> Office, by denying a neceſſitie of divine Revelation and Illumination, in order to Salvation. It
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42100:99"/>undermines his <hi>Imporial</hi> Throne as King, by denying him any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over the human Wil. It diſpirits his <hi>ſpecial Love</hi> to the Elect, by attributing to him univerſal grace and love to al, even Reprobates. [7] It takes away the office of the Spirit of Grace. [8] It enervates the whole Covenant of Grace, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the whole of mans Salvation to a Covenant of Workes. Yea [9] whiles it ſeems to exalt the Law of God, it doth really take away the uſe thereof as a rule of life. Theſe and many other are the injuries which this Free-wil offers to God and man.

Can a vitiated corrupt Wil be ſuppoſed to have any natural connexion with, or Virtue formally effective of a divine life?

Is it not more becoming the human Wil to be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the divine? Muſt we take the adequate reaſon of Gods diſpenſing grace from the emprovement of Nature? Is not the gift of Grace a participation of the divine Nature? Muſt it not then excede the whole ſphere of create Nature? Is it not ſtrange Theologie, to reduce the diſcrimination of good and evil men to the contingence of mans ambulatorie corrupt Free-wil?

                        </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>For there was the ſame forme of Politie then as now, namely Ariſtocratie, under which now we live, and have kept the ſame for a long time. Some would cal it Democratie, others by another name. But to ſpeak truth it is the Gubernation of the beſt men, with the peoples conſent. For we had in times past Kings: and theſe truly ſometimes came to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement by enheritance, ſometimes by the ſuffrage of the people. But now, ſithat the power is in the people, they commit the Administration to ſome most excellent and virtuoſe perſons: neither is any laid aſide by reaſon of infirmitie, or povertie, or low degree of parentage; neither, if the contrary conditions are found, is he therefore promoted, as in other Cities: but there is one Rule of determining al Offices, namely he that is judged the wiſest and best man, he is called to public Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration and Office. And the cauſe of this Adminiſtration among us is our equalitie and paritie as to origine. For other Cities being compoſed of perſons different and inequal, they have inequal and different formes of Adminiſtration, namely Tyrannie and Oligarchie: alſo ſome are Slaves, others Lords: but we, being borne al of one Mother, judge it not equal, that ſome be Lords, and ſome Vaſſals: but that equalitie of ſtock hath made us to find out this equalitie of Politie, that none precede the other, but in the eſtime of Wiſdome and Virtue. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their parents and ours having been educate! in al kind of libertie, many noble deeds for the commun utilitie of Mankind have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: having always judged it neceſſary for libertie, to fight againſt the Grecians for the Grecians, and against the Barbarians for the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> Thus <hi>Plato</hi> of the Athenian Politie, wherein he ſhews, that <hi>Democratie</hi> doth not require, that al Adminiſtrations be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the people, but that the ſupreme Power be in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that they be their free ſuffrage elect ſuch as they judge to excel in Wiſdome and Virtue as Adminiſtrators, or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of public Affaires.

                        </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>There are as it were two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of public Administrations or Polities, out of which he that ſhal ſay other formes of Gubernation reſulted, ſpeaks the truth: the one of theſe is called Monarchie, the other Democratie: the former is most eminently in uſe among the Perſians, the later among us. And almoſt al other kinds of Polities are variouſly compoſed out of theſe. And it's neceſſary, that a Citie, which would enjoy her libertie and amitie with prudence, participate of both of theſe: which indeed our commun ſpeech ſignifies, when we ſay, that a Citie deſtitute of theſe cannot be rightly adminiſtrated and governed.</hi> In which he demonſtrates that <hi>Regal Monarchie</hi> contempered with <hi>popular Democratie</hi> is the moſt equal and beſt of Dominations, provided that it be wel confined and bounded by Laws: for ſuch a mixed Politie comes neareſt to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne Autoritie, which is moſt natural.</p>
                     <p>By comparing theſe Philoſophemes of <hi>Plato</hi> it is evident, that, according to his mind,<note place="margin">Mixed Politie its uſe.</note> a <hi>mixed Politie</hi> or <hi>Gubernation</hi> of <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, Ariſtocratie,</hi> and <hi>Democratie,</hi> if wel limited and bounded by Laws, is generally uſeful. Thus the Stoics alſo held, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>That the best Politie or Regiment, is that which is mixed of Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Regal Power, and Aristocratie,</hi> as <hi>Laertius</hi> in <hi>Zeno.</hi> And the reaſons hereof are theſe: <hi>Monarchie</hi> has an <hi>unitive efficace,</hi> for the rpeventing Diviſion, Diſſolution, and Ruine; which uſually ariſeth out of Factions; unto which <hi>Democratie</hi> and <hi>Ariſtocratie</hi> is obnoxious: <hi>Democratie</hi> hath a <hi>diffuſive facultie,</hi> as it takes in the concernes and intereſt of each individual: <hi>Aristocratie</hi> has a

Thy Grandfather pardoned thoſe whom he conquered: for had he not pardoned them, whom ſhould he have had to reigne over? The power of Tyrants is execrable, but ſhort: A Tyrant differs from a King in deeds, though not in name: He erres, who thinkes a King to be ſafe there, where nothing is ſafe from the King: the ſecuritie of a Prince is maintained by the mutual ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of his Subjects: The love of the Citizens is the inexpug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Fortreſſe of the King. Al crudelitie is from infirmitie: neither can that power ſtand long which is upheld by the evils and ſufferings of many: It's neceſſary that he feareth many, whom many fear. It's more dangerous to be feared, than to be deſpiſed. It's Sacrilege to hurt the Countrey; therefore alſo to hurt a Citizen, who is part thereof.</q> Some have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the reaſon why Nature hath not given a ſting to the King of the Bees, is to teach Princes, that nothing becomes Princes leſſe than Tyrannie; alſo that their only defenſe ſhould be in the

For ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Metaphyſics poſſeſſed the Scholes, al men have endeavored to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their metaphyſic Philoſophemes to them, as the original Exemplar, on a ſuppoſition that they were a part of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s genuine Workes. But I conceive it no difficult thing to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, what ſome Learned men have undertaken, that thoſe <hi>Metaphyſics,</hi> which paſſe under <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s name, are ſpurious, and not to be reckoned among his genuine Workes. For who can imagine, that ſuch a learned and accurate man as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was, ſhould be guilty of ſo great an abſurditie, as to ſtuffe up a great part of his Metaphyſics, with the <hi>ten Predicaments,</hi> and other Logic Notions, which he had ſo prolixely handled in his Organ of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic? May we not take it for granted, that nothing properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42100:126"/>to Metaphyſics, but what is ſupernatural, as the name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes? Yea doth not the ſynonymous title, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is ſaid to give this Science, cut off above the moitie of his Metaphyſics? For <hi>Stobaeus</hi> tels us, <hi>That it was</hi> Ariſtotles <hi>manner to cal Metaphyſic, Theologie.</hi> And this indeed he learned from his Maſter <hi>Plato,</hi> who ſeems to attribute unto Metaphyſic one and the ſame Idea with natural Theologie; the object whereof is God and things ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, ſo far as they may be contemplated by natural light.

                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. and denotes thus much, that God, who is the firſt, yea only indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent eſſential Being, is the prime Cauſe and ſupreme Object of al Sapience, of which hereafter more fully. As for the proper act, properties and effects of Sapience in the general, we have fully handled them, in <hi>Philoſ. Gen. P.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>§. 2.<note place="margin">Metaphyſic a natural Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> We define Metaphyſic a <hi>natural Sapience,</hi> whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from ſupernatural divine Theologie. It's true, <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems to make al Sapience divine and ſupernatural. Thus in his <hi>Epino. pag.</hi> 989. he makes al true knowlege of God to be from God. So <hi>Repub.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 483. he proves, <q>That the mind of man needs divine illumination for the underſtanding things divine, as much as the eye needs the light of the Sun to ſee things viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</q> Hence alſo <hi>Plotinus, En.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 546. makes God to be the <hi>eſſential Sapience,</hi> from whom al the rayes of created Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pience ſtream, as beams from the Sun. But in as much as theſe Gentile Philoſophers came altogether ſhort of al ſupernatural knowlege of God, which ſince the Fal of man is by God appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the ſecond Covenant, it neceſſarily follows, that if we wil make Metaphyſic a Science diſtinct from ſupernatural Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Theologie, it can be no other than a <hi>natural Sapience</hi> of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſupernatural: ſuch as the wiſer of the Philoſophers, <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> attained unto, partly by the advantage they had from oriental Traditions, and partly from the working of their own inquiſitive minds thereon. So that by Metaphyſic here we underſtand only that <hi>natural Sapience,</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi> and other Philoſophers gained by their own inquiſitive thoughts, dwelling on oriental Traditions, and may be further improved by natural contemplation on objects ſupernatural. For we ſee by daily experience what great contemplations of God and things divine the natural mind of man may arrive unto, by means of ſupernatural Revelations, and the workings of his own thoughts thereon, together with ſome more commun illuminations of the Spirit; without any ſupernatural divine knowlege. We find this fully exemplified in multitudes of Platonic myſtic Divines, who have given us many raiſed ſublime ſpiritual notions of ſome
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42100:127"/>of the higheſt Myſteries in Theologie, without any ſupernatural knowlege or ſenſe thereof. The ſame may be ſaid of many Schole-men, their contemplations of God and things divine. Again we cal Metaphyſic a <hi>natural Sapience,</hi> as it has for its fundament or proper ground <hi>rational Arguments,</hi> whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from ſupernatural Theologie, which has for its proper ground and foundation divine Teſtimonie and Autoritie. In Metaphyſic, as it is a part of Philoſophie, Reaſon is the higheſt Autoritie; but in Theologie the Autoritie of God is the higheſt Reaſon. Yet in as much as Metaphyſic ought to be ſubordinate to Theologie, we alſo may, yea ought ſometimes to explicate and demonſtrate ſeveral parts thereof by divine Teſtimonies. For as Metaphyſic at firſt borrowed its object from Theologie, ſo ſome of its beſt Arguments, Demonſtrations and Explications are to be fetcht thence.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. The proper <hi>Act</hi> of Metaphyſic is <hi>Contemplation:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The proper act of metaphyſic Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</note> whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>moral Prudence,</hi> which chiefly regards <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Thence in the Platonic Definitions, <hi>Sapience</hi> is defined <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a contemplative Science.</hi> Not that <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Action from Sapience and Metaphyſic, or Contemplation from moral Prudence and Ethics: for no active Science can be wel managed without contemplation, neither is any contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Science right, if it end not in Action. So that contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and active Sciences, according to <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> are not to be oppoſed, but compoſed, and made ſubordinate each to other; at leaſt the former to the later: Contemplation ought to aſſiſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Morals; and Action ought to crown Contemplation in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſics. When therefore we make Contemplation the proper Act of Metaphyſic, in diſtinction from Action, which is the proper effect of moral Prudence, it muſt be underſtood, not in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s ſenſe, who makes contemplative or ſpeculative, and active or practic Sciences oppoſite ſpecies, and ſo inconſiſtent each with other; but in <hi>Plato</hi>'s, who, <hi>Repub.</hi> 2. diſtributes Diſciplines into <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Whence the object of Metaphyſic being things divine, its proper Act muſt neceſſarily be <hi>Contemplation:</hi> For the higheſt and moſt noble act of the Soul about things ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and divine is contemplation; whence al Affections and Actions proportionable thereto follow in their courſe. Hence
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42100:128"/>the formal Beatitude of the rational Soul is generally placed in viſion or contemplation as the principal part thereof.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Plato</hi> explicates the original roots of Atheiſme,<note place="margin">The Origine of Atheiſme.</note> which began to ſpring up in his days, with its prodigioſe nature, and peſtiferous maligne influences. 1.

                        </gap>, <hi>There are ſome who thinke, that they who are much converſant in the ſtudies of theſe Arts and Sciences, namely Aſtronomie, and other cognate neceſſary Diſciplines, become Atheiſts; from an apprehenſion, that things are made and governed by the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of certain natural Cauſes, and not by the force and providence of the divine Wil.</hi> In which Platonic Philoſopheme there are theſe Propoſitions worthy of our contemplation. (1) <hi>That there was an opinion abroad, that the Mathematics and other Sciences made many Atheiſts.</hi> (2) <hi>That Philoſophie abuſed made men Atheiſts, by reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42100:129"/>al the Products, Events, and Phenomena of the natural and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic World into natural Cauſes, not the divine Wil and Providence.</hi> (3) <hi>That theſe Atheiſtic infuſions and perſuaſions ſprang not really from Philoſophie, but the abuſe thereof.</hi> Theſe Platonic notions we ſhal endeavor more fully to explicate in the following Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Atheiſme <hi>1.</hi> from Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme.</note> 
                        <hi>Atheiſme was not the firſt-borne of corrupt Nature, but was uſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the World by Polytheiſme, its elder Brother, and nurſed up by vain Philoſophie and carnal Policie.</hi> So long as the Deitie maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an awe and reverence towards it ſelf in the conſciences of men, by a ſenſe of its prodigioſe operations in creating and governing the World, Atheiſme found no place in Nature. We hear little of it til the beginning of the Roman Monarchie: at which time God withdrew the ſenſible experiments and prodigioſe effects of his Omnipotence, which had ſo long preſerved the old World from Atheiſme: But beginning now to governe the World more by wiſdome, without thoſe miraculoſe operations before vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to the infant-world, the effects of his power were not ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: whence the brutiſh ſenſual World began to cal in queſtion the very exiſtence and providence of God, and that from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ridiculous Deities which were idoliſed by men. For Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme gave a great advance to Atheiſme: To multiplie the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie is to deſtroy it: he that has power to believe many Gods, is very capable of falling into Atheiſme, to believe there is no God. The corrupt mind of man obſerving bright impreſſes and characters of the Deitie in the workes of his hands, began very early to worſhip the Creature inſtead of the Creator, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19-23. Hence ſprang up firſt <hi>Zabaiſme</hi> or planetary Deities, and then <hi>Helleniſme</hi> or <hi>Polytheiſme,</hi> a multiplicitie of al manner of Gods; which laid a foundation for Atheiſme: For he that is inclined to believe a pluralitie of Gods, may eaſily be induced to believe there is no God. So intimate is the cognation and connexion between Polytheiſme and Atheiſme: As the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> believes there is no God, ſo the <hi>Polytheist,</hi> or ſuperſtitioſe perſon wiſhes there were none: for al ſuperſtition has a legal fear wrapped up in its bowels, which ſtrikes at the very Being of the Deitie. But albeit Polytheiſme opened the dore to Atheiſme, yet it was hatcht, nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and maintained by vain Philoſophie and carnal Policie, as we have at large proved, <hi>Court Gent. P.</hi> 3. <hi>B.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 1. §. 4.</p>

                        <hi>Philoſophie abuſed makes men Atheists, by reſolving al the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of Nature, and States into natural Cauſes, excluſively as to the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42100:129"/>Divine Wil and Providence.</hi> This lies evident in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme before cited. Who makes mention (1) of <hi>Astronomie,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Mathematics,</hi> as influential on Atheiſme. For the Pagan Aſtronomers then, as many judicial Aſtrologers now, held, that there was a natural ſubordination of al inferior Cauſes and Effects to the Stars: whence they reduced al natural effects, yea many politic, to abſtract formes and figures: to ſome inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Influences or fatal Neceſſitie. Again, Mathematicians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uring themſelves to ocular ſenſible Demonſtrations, expect the ſame in divine maters: a bare Teſtimonie, though never ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ſignifies little or nothing with them: whence they disbelieve every divine Myſterie, which fals not under certain rational De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. Witneſſe the great <hi>Leviathan</hi> of our Age and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (for ſo he is pleaſed to title his Book) who has not been aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make public profeſſion of his Atheiſme, and disbelief of althings, which admit not of ſenſible Demonſtration. (2) <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiologie</hi> or <hi>natural Philoſophie,</hi> as alſo <hi>Medicine</hi> has had no ſmal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on Atheiſme; in that ſome of the principal Maſters in theſe Sciences have endeavored to reduce al natural products and effects, either to the accidental Concurſe of Atomes; or to ſome hidden virtues and ſpirits in Nature; or to the various modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mater; or to ſome mundane Spirit, excluſive as to the <hi>first Cauſe</hi> and <hi>divine Providence.</hi> Thus we find the firſt appearance of Atheiſme to be among thoſe philoſophic Wits of <hi>Grece, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, Epicurus,</hi> &amp;c. who did al ways poſſible trie if they could ſalve the Phenomena of Nature without a Deitie. (3) <hi>Eristic Logic</hi> has had too great influence on Atheiſme, as <hi>Plato, Repub.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 539. ſeems to intimate, telling us, <hi>That young men, by frequent Dialectic litigations and contradictions each of other, at last come to disbelieve every thing.</hi> For Scepticiſme naturally tends to Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme: he that diſputes every thing, at length comes to believe nothing, even in things divine. (4) But yet the principal Parent and Nurſe of Atheiſme has been in al Ages <hi>carnal Policie.</hi> The chief lineaments of Atheiſme were formed at <hi>Rome,</hi> when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Seat of State-policie. For the ſecular Politician aſcribes al the revolutions of States and human Affaires to ſome politic contrivement or defect therein. And what makes the preſent Conclave at <hi>Rome</hi> and al their adherents ſo much to abound with Atheiſme, but the great confidence they have in their carnal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie? Neither hath this politic Atheiſme infected <hi>Rome</hi> only, but
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42100:130"/>alſo diffuſed it ſelf throughout the European World. Hence <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel,</hi> that great ſecular Politician of <hi>Florence,</hi> layeth Atheiſme at the foundation of his carnal policie. And it is to be feared there are too many ſuch politic Atheiſts amongſt us: ſome are ſo bold and daring, as that they are not aſhamed openly to profeſſe it: others, by their doutful Scepticiſme give cauſe of ſuſpicion. I wiſh we had not too ſtrong motives to force ſuch a belief, that a great part of thoſe who profeſſe themſelves Chriſtians, had they but the advantages of intereſt and ſuch like ſelfiſh motives, could with as much facilitie turne Atheiſts. It is natural to carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and policie to ſtep up into the Throne of God, and take the Sceptre of his Providence out of his hand, as we find it exemplified in <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi>

And I wil tel thee what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>namely no one of them, who from their youth entertained this opinion that God is not, hath perſevered therein even unto old age.</hi> We find a great inſtance hereof in <hi>Bion,</hi> (mentioned by <hi>Laertius</hi> in his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42100:131"/>Life) <q>who in his health ſaid: <hi>The Gods were nothing:</hi> but being worne out by a long diſeaſe, and fearing death, he acknowleged their exiſtence, &amp;c.</q> 
                        <hi>Plato</hi> addes: <hi>As for the two other opinions about God, namely</hi> (1) <hi>that there is a God, but yet he doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard human affaires;</hi> or (2) <hi>if he doth regard them, yet that he is eaſily reconciled by the prayers and ſacrifices of men, there have been ſome, though not many, who have been infected with theſe blaſphemous ſentiments of the Deitie. Plato</hi> here, as before in the beginning of this Dialogue, <hi>pag.</hi> 885. mentions three ſorts of Atheiſts, which in his days diffuſed their venimous blaſphemies againſt the Deitie. (1) Such as denied the <hi>Exiſtence of God.</hi> (2) Such as held there was a God, but yet denied his <hi>Providence</hi> and Governement of human affaires. (3) Such as held Gods providence and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mens good and evil acts, but yet withal denied the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> of God in puniſhing ſin, affirming that God was eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by Prayers and Sacrifices. Now <hi>Plato</hi> ſets himſelf to refute each of theſe, of which hereafter. The laſt of theſe three kinds takes in practic Atheiſme, which is indeed of al the moſt peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous and diffuſive. For when men believe there is a God, and that the World is governed by him, yet, then to thinke that he wil be pacified by their hypocritic and imperfect prayers and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, is, in <hi>Plato</hi>'s eſtime, an high piece of Blaſphemie and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic Atheiſme: and therefore he ſpends much force of Argument to prove, <hi>That the righteous God cannot be pacified by the ſervices of the wicked.</hi> Of which we ſhal diſcourſe more fully, in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God. <hi>Plato, Repub.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 886. tels us, <hi>That thoſe who truely believe the Exiſtence of God, wil not indulge themſelves in ſin.</hi> Whence the Stoics, following <hi>Socrates,</hi> held, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>That every wicked man was an Atheiſt.</hi> For they held there were two forts of Atheiſts, (1) <hi>Such as were contrary to God.</hi> (2) <hi>Such as deſpiſed God, by diſobeying his Laws,</hi> &amp;c. And it was a great Saying of <hi>Picus,</hi> Earle of <hi>Mirandula, That there was but one thing in the World worſe than a ſpeculative Atheiſt, and that was a practic Atheiſt.</hi> The roots of practic Atheiſme lie low, as an inſenſible Spring and Principle, which moves and workes al, and yet is not diſcerned. Some of the greateſt Profeſſors of a Deitie, may be the greateſt practic Atheiſts.</p>

Doth it not expoſe a man to a miſerable venture of al future miſeries, but ſtrip him naked of al hopes of future happineſſe? Is not every Atheiſt divided againſt himſelf? Do not thoſe remains of light in Conſcience, and thoſe ſecret fears of a Deitie war againſt his corrupt atheiſtic Ratiocinations? Have not his irregular paſſions ful libertie to captivate him and tyranniſe over him without check? Yea, doth he not bid farwel to his beſt being, his firſt cauſe and laſt end?

And yet is not this the caſe of every Atheiſt? Doth he not diſclaim his original Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Root, Sun, Parent and firſt Cauſe? Alas! how much doth he depoſe and forfeit his Reaſon, yea human Nature!

For where there are generations and corruptions, there muſt be cauſes and effects, which implie prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and poſterioritie: for the cauſe naturally precedes the effect: but can there be any prioritie and poſterioritie in what is eternal?

Moreover doth not generation and corruption ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an inequal ſucceſſion of aſcent and deſcent? and is not this incompatible with an eternal Being? Again, if there were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſucceſſion of generations and corruptions, how is it poſſible there ſhould be any effect or iſſue? for can there be an end, where there is no beginning?

What! were theſe corporeous Particles <hi>eternally</hi> there; or only introduced in time? If eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, then is not neceſſary that they be invariable and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? for doth not al variation and alteration belong to time the meaſure thereof? Can any thing that is in a ſtrict ſenſe eternal varie? are not eternal and variable termes contradictorie, as before? Or wil they ſay, that theſe Atomes were introduced or produced in this vacuous ſpace in time? muſt they not then have ſome cauſe of their production? And wil it not hence follow, that there is a firſt Cauſe or Deitie, as anon? Again, what a world of abſurdities, yea contradictions is this Epicurean Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis clogged with? Is it poſſible to imagine that ſuch minute corporeous Particles ſhould, in this imaginarie vacuitie, be inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an eternal gravitie, whereby an eternal caſual motion is cauſed here and there, without any tendence to a Centure? Can it alſo be imagined, that theſe poor Corpuſcules ſhould continue in perpetual motion, til by chance they hit one againſt the other, and ſo were conglomerated into this order we find them in the Univerſe? Is it not a fond ſick-brain conceit, that phlegmatic dul mater, and ſtupid motion ſhould by chance produce ſuch an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Univerſe?

Again, if in the ſubordination of Cauſes there ſhould be an infinite Series, then it would follow hence, that there never was any Cauſe which was not ſubſequent to infinite Cauſes precedent: whence alſo it would follow, that there were infinite Cauſes before any Cauſe. (2) That nothing ever did or can make it ſelf is moſt evident from multitudes of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that follow this Hypotheſis: for then a thing ſhould be ſaid to act phyſically before it had a being: to be ſuperior and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, dependent and independent, to exiſt and not to exiſt in the ſame inſtant and in one and the ſame reſpect.

If from an innate ſelf-originated principe of motion, then muſt not ſuch a motion neceſſarily be eternal? and if eternal, then can a thing that ſo moves ever ceaſe to move? Can any thing move, that was not at firſt moved by ſome prime Motor, or that doth not <hi>infinitely</hi> and <hi>eternally</hi> move it ſelf? Can we imagine any thing not to have a beginning, but what is infinite and eternal? And need we a better argument to prove that al motion had a beginning, than this, that we ſee it has an end? Do not the ſeveral periods, which al motions as wel natural as artificial fal under, clearly evince, that they are not ſelf-originated, but had ſome beginning and prime Motor? This Demonſtration <hi>R. Moſes Maimonides, in ſumma Talmud. lib. de fund.

Has not the Soul a phyſic Amplitude, yea infinite Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, albeit only remote and paſſive of contemplating ſome firſt Truth, and loving ſome chiefeſt good? Has not the mind an univerſal empire and dominion over al objects, to compound things moſt oppoſite, and divide things moſt intimately conjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to deſcend from the higheſt cauſe to the loweſt effect, and then to aſcend from the loweſt effect to the higheſt cauſe? Has not the Wil an infinite thirſt after good, yea is never ſatisfied without the fruition of ſome ſupreme infinite good? And do not theſe infinite capacities, albeit only natural, remote and paſſive, implie ſome infinite object adequate thereto? Was there ever a facultie or power in Nature without an object ſuited thereto? <hi>Cicero</hi> tels us, <hi>de Nat.

Doth not every human Soul carrie the ſignature and marque of his Creator impreſſed on it ſelf? Is there not an impreſſe and Idea of a Deitie incorporated and contempered in the very complexion and conſtitution of the Soul? And albeit man by ſin runs away as a fugitive from his Lord and Maker, yet has he not ſecured his claim to man, by his marque and phyſic Idea ſtamped on the Soul of man?

                        </gap>, <hi>commun and innate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Among which they reckon up ſuch as theſe: <hi>That there is a God: that this God was the Maker, and is the Conſervator, and Rector of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe: that he is infinitely wiſe, juſt, good, &amp;c. That he is to be worſhipped: that virtue is to be embraced, vice avoided,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe commun notices they make to be connate and engraven on the Soul. And indeed ſacred Philoſophie aſſures us, that there are ſuch commun notices of good and evil naturally engraven on mens conſciences, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. which yet are improved by the workes of Providence, as <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. where <hi>rain</hi> and <hi>fruitful ſeaſons</hi> are ſaid to be Gods witneſſe. Now al Notions of good and evil clearly demonſtrate the exiſtence of a Deitie: for the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of good and evil, as to man, refers to ſome principe above him: were there no ſupreme Rector and Judge to reward good and puniſh evil, the very notions of good and evil would vaniſh into ſmoke and vapor. What can be good, if there be not ſome Being originally and infinitely good, to which it refers, and by whole Law it is meaſured? Can we imagine how the notions of good and evil ſhould exiſt in mens minds, if there were not a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Rector to give Laws for the meaſure thereof? If man had not ſome ſupreme Lord to give Laws to him, how could he be guilty of any moral tranſgreſſion? Can he that is his own Law be guilty of an offence? Who can charge any man with doing il, unleſſe he break the Law of ſome Superior? What could be juſt or unjuſt, if there were not a ſupreme Rector to meaſure and regulate the ſame? And could there likewiſe be any puniſhments or rewards, if there were not an infinitely wiſe and righteous Judge to diſtribute the ſame? Again, we may with facilitie evince the exiſtence of a Deitie from the <hi>Accuſations, Tremblements,</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> of a guilty Conſcience. The Atheiſt may diſpute againſt a Deitie, but doth he not ſometimes fear and tremble at a ſecret apprehenſion of that Deitie he diſputes againſt? When the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants of Death come to arreſt him, what pannic fears, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions are in his Conſcience? Doth he not quake and tremble before that Deitie he formerly derided? Thus it was with <hi>Bion</hi> the Philoſopher, who when he lay under the pangs and terrors of death acknowleged that Deitie he before diſclaimed. And would the Atheiſt be but true to himſelf, and ſo ingenuous as to lay
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42100:138"/>open his breaſt, would not his own tremblements and fears of Conſcience at times baſſie his own infidelitie and disbelief of a Deitie? Have not al Nations in al Ages more or leſſe fallen down before the Notion of a Deitie? O! what ſtings and remorſes have there been on the Conſciences even of thoſe who have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emted from the puniſhment of human Laws? Have not many Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants trembled on the Throne, as <hi>Felix,</hi> when the condemned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent rejoyced, as <hi>Paul?</hi> Aske <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> thoſe potent Emperors, what made them to tremble and fear?

It's true we hear of ſome that live without human Laws, yea without clothes and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to ſecure them from the injuries each of other, and of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp;c. but did we ever hear of any that lived without ſome ſupreme object of Devotion? May you not aſſoon find a Nation without men, as without ſome Deitie? Nay, are not ſome ſo ſuperſtitioſe, as where-ever they ſee any created impreſſe of a Deitie, to worſhip that as God? Are not the Plants in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the Birds that flie, the Fiſhes in the Sea, the Brutes that ſerve men, worſhipped by ſome as Gods? And leſt men ſhould after al miſſe of the true God, have they not alſo framed an Altar to ſome unknown God, as <hi>Act.</hi> 17.23? Have not al men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally recourſe to ſome ſupreme Being in their extremities? When they find themſelves paſt their own protection, do they not caſt their eye upward to ſome omnipotent Being for relief? Wil the Atheiſt object, that al theſe religioſe Rites and Actions are but the politic contrivement of Politicians, to keep men in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42100:138"/>awe and under ſubjection? <hi>Plato, Leg.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 889, &amp;c. gives a ful anſwer to this Objection, aſſuring us, <hi>That it is void of al rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to imagine, that Religion and al ſenſe of a Deitie is the mere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or figment of men, inſtituted as an Artifice, to keep men in their Dutie, by overawing them with the conceit of ſome ſupreme Power: than which there cannot be a more capital crime, becauſe the notion of a Deitie is moſt naturel.</hi>

The force of this Argument lies in this, <hi>That the Conſtitution of al Republics, Nations, and politic Societies is ſuch, that the notices of a ſupreme Rector and Deitie are abſolutely neceſſarie for the preſervation of them.</hi> Is it poſſible, that there ſhould be any politic civil Societie, unleſſe there be ſome bond of Confederation and Conſociation? And can there be any Confederation without ſome fidelitie and confidence each in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Who wil aſſociate with others, unleſſe they can confide in them, at leaſt be ſecure, that they ſhal not be ruined by them? Who wil care to live and converſe with ſuch, as they look on as their enemies, and by whom they expect to be deſtroyed? And what ground can there be of confidence and truſt in any, if the notions of a ſupreme Rector and Deitie be baniſht out of the world? Who wil make conſcience of keeping his word, or not violating al bonds and obligations, if he be not overawed by a ſenſe of ſome ſupreme Rector that can puniſh and reward him? Let us ſuppoſe a Citie or Republic of Atheiſts incorporated under ſome commun Laws, and conſider what confuſion, diſorders, and inevitable ruine would follow on ſuch an Hypotheſis. Would there be any regard or conſcience made of words or actions? Doth not. the Atheiſt, who denies any God above him, deſtroy
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42100:139"/>al conſcience within him? And he that knows he makes conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of nothing, wil alſo believe, that al his Companions, who are acted by the ſame atheiſtic principes, make no conſcience of word or deed towards him: and then what diffidences, jealouſies, and treacheries neceſſarily follow hereon? Surely nothing gives men greater confidence and ſecuritie from inhuman violences than a conſcience and ſenſe of ſome ſupreme Deitie, who is juſt to puniſh offenders. Would not every man without this be as a Leviathan, ready to devour his neighbor? Wel indeed might that daring Atheiſt title his Book of Politics <hi>Leviathan,</hi> ſeing every Atheiſt is or would be ſuch, if he follow his own principes?

Thus we ſee miſerable confuſions and diſſolutions in States and Republics follow on the denying a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſupreme Rector of the politic World. Doth not then the Atheiſt in denying the Being of a Deitie, deny the wel-being, yea ſubvert the very Being of the politic World, and al civil Societie?</p>

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42100:144"/>is the adequate reaſon and cauſe why it exiſtes. <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence</hi> have one and the ſame formal Idea in God; becauſe he exiſtes in and by his own Eſſence. It is not ſo in Creatures: they cannot be ſaid to exiſt in and by the force of their own eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but by the force of their cauſes, ſpecially the firſt: whence it follows, that they are Beings not by eſſence, but by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reception of eſſence and exiſtence from the firſt Cauſe. Hence, (3) God is a Being <hi>abſolutely and ſimply neceſſary.</hi> For God exiſting in and by his own Eſſence, it is impoſſible for him not to exiſt: his Eſſence is ſo infinitely and abſolutely perfect, as that it includes exiſtence, yea an impoſſibilitie of not exiſting. Exiſtence agrees not <hi>eſſentially</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> to any Creature, but <hi>contingently:</hi> whatever Creature exiſtes, might not have exiſted, and may yet not exiſt, if it ſeems good to the firſt Being. But the firſt independent Being has Exiſtence abſolutely and ſimply neceſſary: he is ſo much in <hi>Act,</hi> as <hi>Ens</hi> in its moſt univerſal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in power: his Eſſence being infinite, neceſſarily and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently contains whatever is or may be of perfection in al Being, either exiſtent or poſſible. Whatever is once eſſentially, ſimply and abſolutely ſuch, is always ſuch; yea neceſſarily ſuch: if a thing be once ſimply and abſolutely poſſible, it is always poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and if it be once ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſary; becauſe what doth not once implie a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, never doth. We ſee in the World ſome things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet not ac tually exiſtent: now al things that are poſſible muſt be reduced to ſome firſt neceſſary Being, that gave them their poſſibilitie, and muſt give them their actual exiſtence, or they wil never attain to it. Hence it follows, that the Eſſence and Exiſtence of the firſt Being is ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary. Whence (4) God is in a ſenſe <hi>Al Being;</hi> becauſe he is the firſt independent ſelf-Being, ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himſelf al Being, and imparting to althings al poſſible eſſence and exiſtence. Al Beings by participation do eſſentially and neceſſarily depend on the firſt neceſſary ſelf Being. This the ſpurious <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> according to the Pythagorean and Platonic mode, expreſſeth by Unitie. <gap reason="foreign">

Hence, (5) Nothing is <hi>univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> commun to, or predicated of the firſt independent Being, and created dependent Beings. It's true we cal the Creature <hi>Ens,</hi> as wel as God; but it muſt be underſtood not <hi>univocally,</hi> but <hi>analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically;</hi> ſo as the notion <hi>Ens</hi> primarily, eminently, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to the firſt Being; and to the Creatures only <hi>analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically,</hi> or as ſome <hi>equivocally.</hi> So alſo Divines make mention of communicable Attributes, commun to God and the Creatures: yet ſo, as that they primarily belong to God, and to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only ſecundarily: albeit they are transferred from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to God, and ſo in their formal Idea are primarily attributed to the Creature. That nothing can predicate univocally of God and the Creature is moſt evident; becauſe an efficient, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a name, taken from that nature, according to an univocal denomination or predication: Now nothing made by God can arrive to the ſame kind of perfection with God; and therefore nothing can be univocally affirmed of God and the Creature.

(1) That there is a God, who is a neceſſary inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Being, has been already proved: hence it is evident, that he can be but one: For a Being abſolutely neceſſary, and from it ſelf, has a neceſſitie of Being ſo far as it is ſingular: therefore it is not multiplicable or more than one. For if a ſingular is not multiplicable; then whatever agrees to any thing as ſingular, admits not of multiplicabilitie. That a Being abſolutely neceſſary and independent has its neceſſitie of Being as ſingular is evident; becauſe ſingularitie is eſſential and neceſſary to a Being abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary as ſuch: for a Being abſolutely neceſſary is ſuch ſo far as in act: and it is in act as ſingular: whence ſingularitie intrinſecally and eſſentially belongs thereto, as <hi>Suarez, Metaph.

This is the bleſſed God: who is therefore <hi>one;</hi> becauſe an <hi>Ens</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

(3) That which is moſt ſingularly perfect, ſelf-ſufficient and infinite can be but one. For if there were two things or more ſingularly perfect and infinite; then they would differ really, or be the ſame. If the ſame, then they are not two: if they really differ, then one has ſomewhat which the other has not: if ſo, then neither is moſt ſingularly perfect and infinite. For infinite comprehendes al perfection. Thus <hi>Damaſcene, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. Fid. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <gap reason="foreign">

Now what partakes of pure Act, but the firſt Being, who was never in poſſibilitie to be, but always a pure Act as to his Eſſence? God the firſt Being is actually and eternally whatever he may be; neither can he ever be what actually he is not. Every Creature had a poſſibilitie not to be before it was; and it ſtil retains the ſame poſſibilitie: but God is ſuch a pure
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42100:149"/>Act, as that not the leaſt <hi>poſſibilitie,</hi> or <hi>potentialitie</hi> can be affirmed of him.

(6) From the <hi>Immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of God. Whatever is compoſite is mutable: for where there is compoſition, there may be diviſion, which implies mutabilitie.

                        </gap>, <hi>Therefore it is most agreable, that thoſe things which are always and equally the ſame, be incompoſite: but things that are otherwiſe, and not the ſame, that thoſe are compoſite.</hi> (7) From the <hi>Infinitie</hi> of God. Whatever is compound has parts: If God has parts, they muſt be finite or infinite: finite they cannot be; becauſe infinite cannot be compoſed of finites: alſo, there is nothing in God, but what is God. Neither can God be compoſed of infinite parts; becauſe there ſhould then be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater than infinite; for the whole is ever greater than ſome one part: alſo there would be many infinites, which implies a contradiction.</p>

But now the firſt Being God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſimple pure Act, without the leaſt ſhadow of paſſive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby al Creatures are terminated and bounded, it thence neceſſarily follows, that he muſt be infinite in Eſſence and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. God actually and eternally is, whatſoever he may be, and cannot hereafter be, that which now he is not. Al Creatures are ſomewhat in poſſibilitie, which they are not as yet in act: whence they have an inclination to or at leaſt a paſſive power for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which they have not: which being attained unto makes them more perfect. But now where there is one pure Act, al perfection is; becauſe there remains no paſſive power or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of receiving additional perfection. Every Act is by ſo

But now the Divine Eſſence, being tranſcendently and eſſentially ſuch, without participation, cannot be limited either way; but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with an infinitude of eſſence and perfection altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible; not preciſe and limited to one kind of perfection, as it is with the Creature, but containing, in a moſt eminent tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent manner, whatever is of perfection in the Creature, Whence it is that the divine Infinitude and Perfection admit a reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For Being ſubſiſting of it ſelf contains in it the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of eſſence: and the perfections of althings belong to the perfection of eſſence: wherefore God being a pure Act, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſiſting of himſelf, nothing of perfection can be wanting to him.

Al perfection importes ſome kind of univerſitie: becauſe that is perfect, to which there is nothing wanting: whence the more any thing is contracted to ſome certain mode of perfection, the leſſe perfect it is: and the more the univerſitie of perfection agrees to any
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42100:156"/>thing, the more it partakes of perfection. Now God having the whole of eſſence in himſelf, muſt neceſſarily have an univerſitie of perfection. God has al kinds, extents, and degrees of perfection in him either formally or eminently: he hath need of nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe infinitely perfect in his eſſence: there is nothing without or within him that may limit or bound his perfection. The moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Creatures have much of imperfection in them; becauſe they are limited in their Beings: one excels in one perfection, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another: but none in al perfections: they are al negatively imperfect, if not privatively. Again, the Creatures perfection is for the moſt part accidental, and ſeparable; as it appears in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels and men: But Gods perfection is eſſential, abſolute and univerſal; and therefore infinite.

God is in both theſe regards perfect, and therefore infinitely ſuch. (1) God wants not any perfection <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively:</hi> For as he is God of himſelf; ſo of himſelf he has al perfection due to himſelf: The moſt ſimple independent Being cannot be deprived of any perfection due to him, as <hi>Suarez</hi> wel demonſtrates, <hi>Metaphyſ.

(2) God is <hi>negatively perfect,</hi> as he wants no <hi>poſſible perfection.</hi> Poſſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is either <hi>create</hi> or <hi>increate.</hi> God, as the firſt Cauſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, contains in him al create poſſible perfection: and as the firſt moſt ſimple infinite Being, al increate poſſible perfection: For the firſt Being is ſuch by a neceſſitie of Being; and therefore abſolutely and infinitely perfect; containing in himſelf either <hi>eminently</hi> or <hi>formally</hi> al created perfections. (1) God contains in himſelf al created perfections <hi>eminently,</hi> as he has ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in a ſuperior eminent degree, as virtually contains what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in an inferior perfection. Whence al the perfections of Creatures, as they are eminently in God, are nothing elſe but the <hi>creatrix Eſſence of God.</hi> The Divine <hi>creatrix Eſſence</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>eminently</hi> althings, as it can by its own eminent virtue and efficace communicate thoſe perfection to althings.

                        </gap>, cannot but contain in himſelf al created perfections in a moſt eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. (2) God contains formally in himſelf al perfections <hi>ſimply ſimple: i. e.</hi> ſuch as in their formal reaſon involve no imperfection, but pure perfection. It's true, no created perfection, according to that adequate reaſon which it hath in the Creature, is <hi>formally</hi> in God, but <hi>eminently</hi> only. For there is not in God any created goodneſſe, &amp;c. but he is ſaid <hi>formally</hi> to contain ſome of thoſe perfections which are in the Creature; becauſe according to them he has a formal convenience with the Creature, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſame perfection is, according to the ſame name and formal reaſon, attributed to God and the Creature, the infinite diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which is between God and the Creature being preſerved,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42100:157"/>as <hi>Suarez, Metaph. Diſp.</hi> 29. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 39. Thus God giving perfection to althings has ſimilitude and diſſimilitude with al: Similitude, in that whatever perfection is in the Creature, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally or eminently in God: Diſſimilitude, in that al thoſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which agree to other things according to diverſe formes or modes of participation, agree to God according to the infinite Unitie and Simplicitie of his Eſſence.

                     <p>Having demonſtrated the Eternitie of God,<note place="margin">What Eternitie is.</note> we now procede to explicate the ſame, ſo far as ſacred Philoſophie gives us light and evidence: For indeed without divine light it is impoſſible for mortal man, who is confined by Time, to contemplate immortal Eternitie. Have not many great errors had either origine from proud mens confining the Eternitie of God to the Laws of Time? This is incomparably wel expreſſed by great <hi>Bradwardine, de Cauſa Dei, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 52. <q>Theſe things, ſaith he, of <hi>Eternitie</hi> I have more copioſely diſcuſſed; becauſe I repute it the moſt difficult thing for temporal man, who is always accuſtomed to meaſure things by the differences and laws of fluent Time, to mount up, above the differences of Time, to the contemplation of Eternitie;which is without mutabilitie of ſucceſſion.</q> And then he gives us an ingenuous confeſſion, that this was his great error, when young and infected wih Pelagian infuſions: <q>I, ſaith he, when I was young and ignorant of the Scriptures, and the power of God, being blinded with this ignorance, or rather borne blind, and deceived with a falſe imagination, I conceited, that the Divine Knowlege and Wil was changed and otherwiſe diſpoſed by the viciſſitudes of Times, as human Knowlege and Wil. As to ſuch as ſuperſicially read the Scriptures it may ſeem, that God is this or that way variouſly affected, as men are. And this ignorance I judge to be the cauſe, why ſome others like to me, thinke that God is otherwiſe and otherwiſe diſpoſed intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, &amp;c.</q> Therefore to cure theſe ignorances and errors about Eternitie we may conſider the following Propoſitions.</p>

Yet we may not ſay that Eternitie doth attemper it ſelf to the nature of things temporal, whiles it comprehendes and meaſures the ſame: For by meaſuring and comprehending things temporal, we only mean, that Eternitie doth coexiſte to them: whereby Eternitie is not more attempered to the nature of time, than time, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting to Eternitie, is attempered to the nature of Eternitie.

Not only things temporarie in their viciſſitudes coexiſte to God and his Eternitie; but alſo God and his Eternitie coexiſtes to them: which denomination implies no viciſſitude in God, or in his Eternitie; but only a viciſſitude of the things temporary, and their gradual ſucceſſion. It's true, as we have before proved, the differences of time <hi>past</hi> and <hi>future</hi> are repugnant to Eternitie, as to al intrinſee denomination: for in Eternitie there is nothing <hi>past</hi> or <hi>future, firſt</hi> or <hi>last:</hi> yet theſe differences are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Eternitie in regard of extrinſec denomination.

(1) If Eternitie in God be an Accident, either it is cauſed by God, or not: if it be cauſed, then it has a beginning, and ſo not Eternitie. If it be an Accident not cauſed by God, then it was cauſed by it ſelf, or without cauſe: which are both abſurd. (2) If the Eternitie of God be an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, then finite or infinite: It cannot be a finite Accident; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a finite duration cannot be commenſurate to an infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

And here we are to remember, that the more general notions of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perfections, albeit they are more imperfect as belonging to the Creature, yet they are more properly attributed to God, than more ſpecial notions; becauſe the former are more abſtract and ſimple, the later more concrete and compoſite: For by how much the higher we aſcend to the generic notions of things, by ſo much the more ſimple our notions are. Hence it is, that <hi>Knowlege</hi> is more properly aſcribed to God, than <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon;</hi> becauſe it is more generic and ſimple: ſo <hi>Life,</hi> than <hi>Vegetation; Spirit,</hi> than <hi>Soul:</hi> hence alſo <gap reason="foreign">

And the reaſon of the whole is this: Seing the Divine Eſſence is more aptly and familiarly expreſſed by <hi>Abnegation</hi> or <hi>Remotion,</hi> than by <hi>Affirmation,</hi> hence it follows, that by how much the more concrete and ſpecial our notions are, by ſo much the leſſe they agree to God; and on the contrary,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42100:172"/>by how much the more ſimple and general they are, by ſo much the more they agree to God; becauſe they are by ſo much the more remote from the imperfections of the Creature, as <hi>Twiſſe, Scient. med. pag.</hi> 309. Hence,</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) The beſt natural way or degree of knowing God is by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> or <hi>Remotion:</hi> for the Divine Eſſence,<note place="margin">

So <hi>Aquinas, Sum.</hi> 1. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 10. <hi>Art.</hi> 1. <q>Things ſimple are beſt defined by Negation; not as if negation were eſſential to them, but becauſe our Intellect, which firſt apprehendes things compoſite, cannot arrive to the cognition of things ſimple, but by the remotion of al compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſame he more fully explicates, <hi>contra Gent. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14. In the conſideration of the Divine Eſſence the way of Remotion is chiefly to be uſed: for the Divine Eſſence, by reaſon of its Immenſitie, excedes al forme that our Intellect can attain unto; wherefore we cannot apprehend it, by knowing what it is; but we have ſome notices thereof, by knowing what it is not. For we by ſo much the more draw near to the knowlege of God, by how much the more we can by our Intellect remove imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from God: for we by ſo much the more perfectly know every thing, by how much the more fully we contemplate its differences from other things: for every thing has in it ſelf its proper eſſence, whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from al other things. But becauſe in the conſideration of the Divine Eſſence we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive what it is, or its <hi>Genus,</hi> nor its diſtinction from other things by affirmative differences, it is therefore neceſſary, that we conceive of it by negative differences.</q> Indeed the moſt ſimple, ſpirital, divine, and excellent things are beſt ſet forth by negatives.

And here indeed we can give only ſome poor conjectures; in as much as nothing is more difficult to be underſtood than <hi>Life,</hi> albeit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more commun. This is one of the Myſteries of Nature; which not falling under the perception of ſenſe, farther than by its effects, we can only give ſome probable conjectures of it. But
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42100:174"/>thus much we find by the effects to be included in the generic notion of Life: (1) a <hi>ſpirituoſe Principe,</hi> or <hi>Spirituoſitie.</hi> So among Animals, by how much the more <hi>ſpirituoſe</hi> they are, by ſo much the more perfect and noble their life is. The <hi>animal</hi> life is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed compoſed of <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>animal</hi> Spirits in agitation: Hence vigor, health, ſtrength, ſenſe, vegetation, and al the iſſues of life procede. And by how much the more potent and vigorous the Spirits are, by ſo much the more active and perfect is the life. So in the <hi>rational Life,</hi> the more ſpirituoſe the exercices of Reaſon, and Wil are, the more perfect the life is. (2) Life in its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric notion importes alſo <hi>Actuoſitie.</hi> Life conſiſtes not in a mere ſpirituoſe principe, but in the agitation of that principe. And the more actuoſe the ſpirituoſe principe is, the more perfect the life is. (3) But the main character that ſeems moſt eſſential to life in the general is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>ſelf-motion.</hi> This <hi>Plato</hi> makes commun to al life, as wel <hi>create</hi> as <hi>increate:</hi> Brutes they have an <hi>animal ſelf-motion,</hi> men <hi>rational,</hi> Angels <hi>intellectile,</hi> but God <hi>abſolute, eſſential,</hi> and <hi>independent.</hi> Thus much being premiſſed of Life in its generic notion, we now procede to explicate how far the Life of God participates hereof.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Life of God carries in it the moſt perfect <hi>Spirituoſitie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Life of God most ſpirituoſe.</note> as he is the moſt ſimple pure Spirit, without the leaſt ſhadow of <hi>Mater</hi> either <hi>phyſic</hi> or <hi>metaphyſic.</hi> The leſſe any thing has of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the more ſpirituoſe it is: Angels and human Souls are called Spirits; becauſe they are void of al <hi>phyſic mater:</hi> but yet they have <hi>metaphyſic mater,</hi> or <hi>paſſive obediential power,</hi> and therefore are not pure ſimple Spirits metaphyſically conſidered. Though I cannot without inhuman violence to mine aſſent take in that notion of a Spirit given us by Learned <hi>More,</hi> in his <hi>Divine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, Dialog.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 24. <hi>pag.</hi> 94, &amp;c. where he makes <hi>extenſion</hi> agreable to a Spirit, and ſo not proper and eſſential to Mater ſolely, according to the Carteſian and ancient Hypotheſis. For if a Spirit be capable of extenſion in a ſtrict and phyſic notion, which he ſeems to defend, I cannot imagine how it ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emt from phyſic mater, and al thoſe laws of phyſic corporeitie, diſſolution, and corruption which attend Mater: yet I can eaſily perſuade my ſelf and grant that learned Author, that al Spirits have, according to the degree of Spiritalitie, an <hi>Amplitude of Eſſence,</hi> which is not confined to the narrow ſpace of a <hi>Needles</hi> point, as the Scholes of old dreamed. As for create Spirits
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42100:175"/>both Angels and human Souls we may juſtly allow them, without injurie offered to their ſpiritalitie, <hi>metaphyſic accidental extenſion,</hi> according to the ſpace they occupie; as alſo <hi>metaphyſic mater,</hi> as compoſed of Act and paſſive obediential power, without the leaſt phyſic extenſion or mater.

Nothing can be ſaid to live farther than it is actuoſe: when it ceaſeth to act, it ceaſeth to live. Life may be conſidered either <hi>in actu primo, the first act,</hi> or <hi>in actu ſecundo, the ſecond act:</hi> the firſt Act of life conſiſtes in the <hi>ſpirituoſe Principe</hi> or <hi>Spirituoſitie</hi> of the Agent, before mentioned: the ſecond Act of life conſiſtes in the <hi>Actuoſitie</hi> or <hi>Operation,</hi> that flows from the firſt Act or Principe. But in the Life of God, which is moſt perfect, <hi>the first and ſecond Act</hi> are one and the ſame; becauſe he is a pure Act, without the leaſt compoſition of <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>first and ſecond Act.</hi> In al created life the Principe or firſt Act is diſtinct from the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or ſecond Act; and both together make an accidental com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Effect,</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Power:</hi> but in the Life of God there is an <hi>Actuation</hi> without any true cauſalitie or proper
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42100:175"/>motion. We muſt conceive therefore of the Life of God as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the moſt perfect <hi>Actuoſitie</hi> and <hi>Actuation,</hi> yet ſo as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude al real <hi>Cauſalitie, Compoſition,</hi> and <hi>Imperfection,</hi> which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendes every create life, by reaſon of the diſtinction between its firſt and ſecond Act, which God admits not; becauſe he is <hi>pure Act</hi> without al <hi>Power,</hi> either <hi>eſſential</hi> or <hi>accidental, active</hi> or <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive:</hi> his <hi>Eſſe</hi> and <hi>Agere</hi> are the ſame: his <hi>Act</hi> is his <hi>Eſſence:</hi> which can be ſaid of no create Being: but of God it muſt be affirmed, becauſe he is the firſt, moſt pure, and perfect Act, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al power either <hi>objective</hi> or <hi>receptive.</hi> The pure Actualitie of God is demonſtrated by this, that <hi>pure Act</hi> is more perfect, than <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Power:</hi> but God is moſt perfect, therefore pure Act. Every power is indigent, needing an Act to actuate the ſame: whence it neceſſarily follows, that we muſt either admit a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe into infinite, or grant ſome firſt pure Act, which needs no other Act for its actuation, as <hi>Bradwardine</hi> acutely demonſtrates, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 163, &amp;c.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42100:177"/>has one and the ſame Idea with the Divine Eſſence; neither is it inveſted with any abſtract <hi>Species, Formes</hi> or <hi>Ideas</hi> of things, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther habitual or actual, diſtinct from the Eſſence of God. It's true, mans Intellect is not, as I conceive, diſtinct from his human Soul; yet it cannot underſtand any object but by ſpecies or ideas actual and habitual diſtinct from its Eſſence. Mans Intellect, as to the Act of Intellection, is <hi>paſſive,</hi> receiving the intelligible ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from its object: which imperfect mode of Intellection ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains not to God, who ſees althings in the glaſſe of his own Eſſence, as anon.

But the Intellect of God receives no impreſſion or cauſalitie from its objects, it being the cauſe of althings. In human knowlege the thing underſtood is the meaſure of our underſtanding; but the divine knowlege is the meaſure of althings known.

That God is the prime Intelligible is evident, becauſe he is the prime immaterial Being. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things are ſo far intelligible, as they are immaterial: therefore God being the firſt immaterial and moſt ſimple Being, he muſt neceſſarily be the firſt Intelligible. And if God be the firſt Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, then there muſt be an Intellect and Science proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to him: which can be no other than himſelf; who is both <hi>Intelligible, Intellect, Intellection,</hi> and <hi>intelligible Species.</hi> Again, God being a pure Act, of ſupreme Immaterialitie, he cannot but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand himſelf by himſelf. For God having nothing of poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie, it is abſolutely neceſſary, that the <hi>Intellect</hi> and intelligible ſpecies be in him the ſame: whence he cannot but underſtand himſelf by himſelf. For in Creatures the thing underſtood being brought into the Intellect by its intelligible ſpecies or idea, hence the perfection of Intellection dependes on theſe two particulars:
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42100:178"/>(1) That the intelligible <hi>Species</hi> or Idea be perfectly conforme to the thing underſtood. (2) That it be perfectly united to the Intellect: which is by ſo much the more perfectly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht, by how much the more efficace the Intellect has in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. But now the Divine Eſſence being both <hi>Intellect</hi> and <hi>intelligible Species,</hi> it cannot but underſtand it ſelf, and althings elſe in the moſt perfect manner. Hence it is that God perfectly underſtandes himſelf, ſo far as he is intelligible: he alſo knows himſelf to be of infinite Power, to have a Wil ſoverain, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and univerſally efficacious. Whence he knows althings elſe in himſelf, his infinite Eſſence and omnipotent Wil.</p>

But to give a more particular demonſtration of Gods knowing althings, we may argue it, (1) from the infinite power of God thus: Gods knowlege is as extenſive as his power: but his power extendes to althings: therefore his knowlege. Thus <hi>Job</hi> 42.2.<note place="margin">Job 42.2.</note>

(2) The Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience of God may be demonſtrated from his Immenſitie and Omnipreſence: Gods Science muſt neceſſarily extend ſo far as his Eſſence;<note place="margin">Jer. 23.23, 24.</note> becauſe his Knowlege is his Eſſence.

In us the <hi>Ideate</hi> or thing underſtood is before the <hi>Idea,</hi> and the original exemplar of al our knowlege; but in God, his Idea is the original Exemplar, and the <hi>Ideate</hi> in the create but a <hi>Parelius</hi> and reflexe image or ſimilitude of the Divine Idea. Al perfections in the Creature flowing from the efficacious Wil of God, muſt neceſſarily preexiſte in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wil and Eſſence, before they exiſte in themſelves: as the effect ever preexiſtes in its cauſe: hence the Divine Intellect comprehendes in the glaſſe of the Divine Eſſence al Creatures, and their proper eſſences, perfections, diſtinctions, reſpects, and operations; and that in a way not of compoſition, but perfect

The divine Eſſence, which repreſentes althings; as an <hi>Exemplar</hi> directes the operation of God in producing the <hi>Exemplates</hi> or things formed according thereunto. For there is ſomething in God that corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondes to al the perfections of Creatures: not as if there were a formal ſimilitude between the Idea and Ideate; but there is ſomething formally exiſting in God that repreſentes al the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Creatures. Thus al the Creatures are in the Divine

For firſt, as the eye doth in a moment take in the moſt remote objects, ſo doth the divine Intellect: whereas al diſcourſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he compares the human intellect, is but ſucceſſive and ſlow. Again, as the Sun doth irradiate one whole Hemiſphere of the Earth in a moment, but is many hours in its moving through it: ſo the divine Intellect doth in a moment of Eternitie compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend al objects; but the human is very ſlow and ſucceſſive in its apprehenſion of things.

(3) In our mode of knowing things, the more diſtinctly we can apprehend any thing by its own evidence and light, the more evident and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is our knowlege; as in our apprehenſion of firſt Principes: wherefore Gods mode of knowing things being moſt perfect, it muſt neceſſarily be without ratiocination. (4) In al diſcourſe the aſſent is the effect cauſed, and the Argument is the cauſe: but Gods Science is not cauſed. (5) In al diſcourſe there is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie and poſterioritie, compoſition and diviſion; which implies much imperfection, and may not therefore be aſcribed to God. (6) In al diſcourſe there is much of ignorance mixed with our knowlege; becauſe it is a progreſſion from that which is more known to that which is leſſe known: But Gods Science hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ignorance mixed with it.

Al human knowlege, being cauſed by Ideas collected from the objects, is mutable and variable, as the objects are; at leaſt ſo far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardes ſingular ſenſible objects: for if the object be contingent and mutable, the Science cannot be neceſſary and immutable: But now the divine Science being no way dependent on the object, it is not obnoxious to thoſe laws of mutation and variation which the object neceſſarily fals under. The Truth of our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is mutable, becauſe dependent on externe objects and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums; but the Truth of the Divine Underſtanding immutable, and therefore the meaſure of al Truth, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> wel notes. This is incomparably wel illuſtrated by <hi>Bradwardine, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 24. <hi>pag.</hi> 244. God, ſaith he, by reaſon of his moſt infinite claritie comprehendes althings, and al particles of time, as they are moſt truely in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: for he needs not comparation or relation of things paſt or future to the preſent inſtant, according to the manner of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man infirmitie; but he underſtandes althings together and moſt
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42100:184"/>clearly by his own Eſſence and Wil, which repreſences althings uniformely and invariably. As if there ſhould be an immobile eye in the Centre of the Heavens, which ſhould ſee by extramiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and actively, as God ſeeth, it would then always ſee uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely without al mutation every part of the Heavens turning round; and the ſame part now in the Eaſt, and anon in the South, and then in the Weſt: Thus God in like manner ſees al variable objects and parts of time, with their diſtinct viciſſitudes and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, without the leaſt variation or ſucceſſion; becauſe he ſees althings, not <hi>paſſively,</hi> by ſpecies and impreſſions received from the things themſelves, but <hi>actively</hi> in his own Eſſence, and Wil, the active Principe of al. We poor mortals, by reaſon of our infirmitie, cannot diſtinctly apprehend al the particles of time, always fluent and ſucceding each other, and therefore we take the <hi>preſent inſtant,</hi> which of al time is moſt actual and beſt known to us, and make it the meaſure of paſt, preſent, and future time: whence our knowlege alſo is ſucceſſive and mutable; but God, who knows althings in his own Eternitie, is not liable to ſuch ſucceſſion and mutation: his Science being a pure neceſſary Act, muſt needs be immutable and invariable, albeit it terminates on objects in themſelves moſt mutable and variable: the mutation of the object makes no mutation in the divine Science; becauſe the mutable object is only the ſecundary object of Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege: the primary object is the divine Eſſence, which is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and therefore the divine Science ſuch alſo. Should Gods knowlege depend on the objects known, then it would be muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as they are, but not otherwiſe. God neceſſarily knows every Entitie both actual and potential: wherefore (1) he can never know any thing that he is ever ignorant of. (2) He can never be ignorant of what he ever knows. (3) He cannot know more of fewer things than he knows. (4) He cannot begin to know what he before knew not, or not to know what before he knew, becauſe nothing begins to be future. This immutabilitie of the divine Science, as to things future, ariſing from the determination of his own ſoverain Wil, and not from any thing in the object, is nervoſely demonſtrated by pious and learned <hi>Robert Groſſeteſte</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> in his elaborate MSS. <hi>De Libero Arbitrio,</hi> which lies buried in <hi>Exeter</hi> College Librarie, <hi>Oxon.</hi> Wherein he copioſely demonſtrates, <hi>That the Cauſes, Origines, and Reaſons of althings future, though in themſelves never ſo inſtable, are most ſtable,

Therefore as nothing is antecedent to the divine Wil, ſo no Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis or condition is cognoſcible or knowable antecedently thereto. Gods knowlege as it dependes not on the exiſtence of created objects, ſo neither on any Hypotheſes or conditions that are appendent unto ſuch objects, placed in ſuch circumſtances. For al futures, whether abſolute or conditionate, are known by God, not from the determination of ſecond cauſes, but from the determinatin of the divine Wil, which is the firſt Cauſe. For whence ſprings the futurition of things, but from the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the divine Wil?

Where any science dependes on its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it cannot be more certain than the object is: whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence belongs to the object, wil alſo influence the Science and make it contingent: whence if the divine Science be certain, as without al diſpute it is, then it cannot depend on its mutable contingent object, but muſt be abſolute and independent. Is it leſſe than blaſphemie to conceive, that the infinite Science of God ſhould depend on any finite object, or finite mutable conditions appendent thereto? Yea, is not ſuch a conditionate Science alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impoſſible as to God? For muſt not the object as ſuch be before the act?

Indeed a <hi>conditionate Science,</hi> to ſpeak properly, is that which as yet never exiſted, but wil follow on the poſition of the condition: whence

How impoſſible then is it, that ſuch a Science ſhould be found in God, who no way dependes on externe objects for his Science? We muſt therefore conclude, that God, in the abſolute and efficacious Decree of his own Wil, hath predetermined al futures both contingent, free, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in particular, and thence certainly and infallibly knows them to be future, both as to their ſubſtance and circumſtances.

And it is obſervable, that the Pſalmiſt grounds the Infinitude of Gods knowlege on the Magnitude or Infinitude of hsi Eſſence and Power: whereby we are informed, that Gods knowlege dependes not on the objects known, but ariſeth from his own omnipotent Wil and Eſſence. The perfection of the Divine Science may be conſidered <hi>eſſentially, intenſively, extenſively.</hi> (1) <hi>Eſſentially,</hi> as Gods knows himſelf perfectly, in himſelf and by himſelf; and althings elſe in himſelf. God knows althings diſtinctly in the claritie of his own Eſſence: thoſe things that are diverſe and multiplied in the Creatures, are moſt <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>unite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in God: Man according to the diverſitie of objects, has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe notices or apprehenſions of things.

(2) Gods knowlege is moſt perfect <hi>intenſively.</hi> For every Intelligent is ſo far perfect as to degrees of knowlege, as he partakes of <hi>Immaterialitie.</hi> Brutes have ſome degree of apprehenſion, as they have ſpirituoſe Souls; but theſe their animal Spirits being but the purer parts of mater, therefore their apprehenſion is moſt imperfect, and not reckoned among the ſpecies of true knowlege. Mans apprehenſion depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding very far upon his ſenſes and material objects, it's therefore more imperfect than that of Angels: yea, the Angelic Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence being made up of act and power, which is a kind of meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſic mater, hence there is much of imperfection mixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42100:186"/>if compared with Gods Intelligence; which being pure Act and exemt from al mater, as wel <hi>metaphyſic</hi> as <hi>phyſic,</hi> hence it is moſt perfect <hi>intenſively</hi> as to al degrees of knowlege. (3) Gods Science is moſt perfect <hi>extenſively;</hi> not as to kinds or <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Science,</hi> (for it is moſt indiviſible and ſimple, without al exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of parts) but as to objects; becauſe it extendeth unto al ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. God, by reaſon of his moſt infinite claritie, comprehendes al particular things, with al the particles of time in and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God being in the higheſt degree immaterial, it neceſſarily follows, that his Science is moſt ample and extenſive as to its object: for every facultie is by ſo much the more extenſive, by how the more immaterial it is: hence the human Intellect by its act of underſtanding is ſaid <hi>to become althings:</hi> how much more true is this of the Divine Intellect, which is in the higheſt degree ſpiritual? The Divine Science albeit it be one moſt ſimple Act in it ſelf, yet it is moſt univerſal and infinite as to its object. Thus <hi>Aquinas, contra Gent. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 78. proves that Gods knowlege extendes to an infinitie of things; becauſe God perfectly knows his own Virtue and Power, which is infinite. Again, by how much the more efficacious and clear any Intellect is in knowing, by ſo much the more able it is from one to gather many things: But now the Divine Intellect being infinitely efficacious, it muſt therefore neceſſarily extend to an infinitude of objects. So <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardine, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 7. proves, <q>That the <hi>Scientivitie</hi> of God and his Intellect is never ſatisfied with any finite or infinite number of exiſtent ſingulars, of any one ſpecies, or al; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely excedes each of them, yea, a whole multitude of al, if they could be congregated together.</q> That the Science of God is moſt perfect <hi>eſſentially, intenſively,</hi> and <hi>extenſively,</hi> ſee <hi>Suarez, Metaph.

                     <p>Having largely diſcuſſed the eſſential Modes or Characters of the Divine Science, we now procede to its diſtinctions,<note place="margin">Gods ſimple Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence.</note> with relation to its objects. For albeit the Divine Science be in it ſelf one ſimple Act, identified with the Divine Eſſence, yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not but that we may, by ſome inadequate conception of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, diſtinguiſh this Science, by reaſon of its object, into different kinds. The commun diſtribution of Gods Science is into <hi>ſimple Intellience,</hi> and <hi>Science of Viſion.</hi> 1. Gods Science of <hi>ſimple Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi> is of althings poſſible; which he contemplates in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficience of his Eſſence. For God being in the higheſt degree
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42100:187"/>Intelligent, he muſt neceſſarily underſtand althings that are intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible: but now whatever may be, may alſo be known: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a poſſibilitie of exiſtence, there is ſome intelligibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Again, God perfectly knows his own Eſſence and Power: therefore he perfectly knows not only what is future, but alſo whatever is poſſible. Not that the exiſtence of things poſſible is known by God, but only their <hi>Eſſence,</hi> which he contemplates in his own EſſEnce. Hence this <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>ſimple Intelligence</hi> is called by ſome <hi>Abſtractive;</hi> becauſe it abſtractes from the actual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of its object.</p>

Dei, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 18. <hi>pag.</hi> 220, &amp;c. largely demonſtrates theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. (1) <hi>That God doth not know things future merely by his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, without the determination of his Wil;</hi> becauſe nothing is in its own nature future, but by the Decree of the Divine Wil. (2) <hi>That God doth not know things future by the Divine Intellect only:</hi> becauſe the Divine Intellect conſidered in it ſelf is not practic, but only as ſubſequent to the Divine Wil. (3) <hi>That God doth not know things future by the Infinitie of the Divine Science:</hi> becauſe the Infinitie of the Divine Science being ſuppoſed, it doth not thence neceſſarily follow, that this or that thing be future. (4) <hi>That God doth not know things future by the knowlege of their ſecond Cauſes:</hi> For ſuch a knowlege implies diſcourſe from the cauſe to the effect: again, ſuch a knowlege would be contingent when the ſecond cauſes are ſuch. (5) <hi>That God doth not know things future by the Infinitie or Immenſitie of his own Scibilitie or Scientivitie.</hi> (6) <hi>That god doth not know things future by the ſole permiſſion of his own Wil:</hi> becauſe then Gods knowlege ſhould not be certain. Hence he poſitively concludes,<note place="margin">God knows things future by his Wil.</note> (7) <hi>That God knows things future by that which gives them their futurition, namely by his Divine Wil.</hi> For, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 1. <hi>Poſt.</hi> 2. inſtructes us, <hi>To know a thing is to know it by its cauſe:</hi> and is not the Wil of God the firſt Cauſe that gives futurition to althings? Again, how can God certainly know future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42100:187"/>ſuch as al human acts are, but in and by ſome neceſſary certain cauſe? And what certain neceſſary cauſe can there be of future contingents but the Divine Wil? We may not then ſearch for the cauſes of Divine Preſcience in things future, but in the cauſe of their futurition, the determination of the Divine Wil. Not as if the decree or determination of the Divine Wil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by things become future, did in any moment of Nature precede the Divine Preſcience; but in one and the ſame moment of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God decrees what ſhal be future, and foreſees it future. Thence he takes the reaſon of his knowing things future, not ſimply from his Eſſence, or ſufficience; nor yet from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentialitie to God, as the Dominicans perſuade us, but from the determination of his own Wil. Certainly Gods Wil is moſt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, omnipotent, immutable, and moſt known to himſelf: and therefore it is neceſſary, that whatever he wils ſhould be fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be ſo, and known to him to be ſo: for he wils not only the things themſelves, but alſo al their modes and conditions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence, neceſſitie, libertie, &amp;c. Whatever gives any thing its futurition muſt neceſſarily alſo give it its cognoſcibilitie or intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibilitie as future: wherefore the Divine Wil giving the former, it cannot alſo but give the later. <hi>Damaſcene, Orthodox.

                        <hi>Scientia Media, a middle Science,</hi> whereby God is ſuppoſed to foreſee ſuch or ſuch events to be future, on condition that ſuch or ſuch cauſes he ſo or ſo conſtituted. This Middle Science (1.) ſuppoſeth that ſome events are certainly future independently as to the Wil of God; which is altogether impoſſibly: for a thing merely poſſible cannot paſs from its ſtate of poſſibilitie to a ſtate of Futurition, without ſome cauſe of that tranſmutation: now there can be no cauſe of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition but the Divine Wil, as we ſhall prove hereafter. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be future either abſolutely or conditionately, but what the Divine Will has decreed ſhal be future: therefore the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42100:188"/>object of this Middle Science cannot be things future, but only poſſible. Doth not this Middle Science, by feigning that future which is only poſſible, overthrow the very foundation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Science as to things future? Is it not impoſſible, that the preſcience of a thing future ſhould precede the decree of its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition? So <hi>Avarez, de Auxil. l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. Nothing can make a thing cognoſcible as future, but what gives futurition thereto: And what gives futurition to any thing, but the decree and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Divine Wil? (2) It ſuppoſeth Gods Science to depend upon its object, which alſo is impoſſible; becauſe then it ſhould be variable and mutable as the object is. Yea, to ſpeak properly, the object of this <hi>Middle Science</hi> is not at al <hi>cognoſcible</hi> or <hi>knowable:</hi> For nothing is knowable farther than it is clothed with ſome degree of neceſſitie, at leaſt as to eſſence or exiſtence: what is not either neceſſarily <hi>exiſtent</hi> or <hi>future,</hi> cannot be known: now the object of this Middle Science is not either <hi>exiſtent</hi> or <hi>future:</hi> therefore not cognoſcible. Again, God takes not the reaſon or idea of his cognition from the things themſelves or any Hypotheſes they fal under, which are al variable, but from the invariable determination of his own Wil, as before. It's true, our <hi>Intuition</hi> and <hi>Cognition</hi> is formed by a paſſive rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ſpecies from its object;<note place="margin">Noſtra intuitio fit patiendo ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>objectis, non ſic intuitio divina.</note> and therefore it is murable and variable, according to the variations of the object: but can we imagine, that this imperfect mode may attend the Divine Intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Cognition? Should the principe and reaſon of the Divine Cognition procede from and depend on its finite object, muſt not God alſo be finite, paſſive, and dependent? Is not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Idea before its Ideate, yea eternal? How then can it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend thereon? (3) This Middle Science ſuppoſeth the Divine Science to be only <hi>conjectural</hi> and <hi>uncertain.</hi> For ſuch as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is, ſuch is the Science thereof: a contingent object cannot give a neceſſary certain Science: al Logic ſcientific neceſſitie is founded in phyſic neceſſitie: That which may otherwiſe be, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be neceſſarily known: as Gods knowlege would be falſe, if he knew thoſe things to be future which ſhal never be; ſo would it be incertain, if the object be not certainly future: if the object be certainly future, it muſt have a certain cauſe of its futurition, which can be no other than the Wil of God. But now, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this hypothetic Middle Science, God cannot divine which way mans Free-wil wil incline it ſelf, before it hath inclined to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42100:189"/>this or that object. and doth not this render the knowlege of God only conjectural, yea no knowlege at al? For how can a thing be certainly known to be future, without ſome cauſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining it to be ſuch? That Gods knows althings future, though never ſo contingent in themſelves, moſt certainly in the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his own Wil, ſee <hi>Greg. Ariminenſ. Sent. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 38. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 2. alſo <hi>Groſſeteſte, de Libero Arbitrio.</hi> Wherefore if God has a certain preſcience of future contingents, as without al per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure he has, we muſt ſearch for the cauſes of this Divine Preſcience, not in the extrinſec objects, which can never give it, but in God himſelf, and in the determination of his own Wil, in regard of which al future contingents are neceſſary; not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but hypothetically, on ſuppoſition of the ſaid determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. (4) This Middle Science enervates and deſtroyeth the Grace of God. [1] It deſtroyes <hi>the Grace of Election;</hi> in that it ſuppoſeth, that <hi>Peter</hi> could from his own free-wil, conſent to the Cal of God, provided he were put under ſuch circumſtances, and inveſted with ſuch commun aides, even antecedently to his Election to Grace and Glorie; which they make to follow the previſion of his Faith by this Middle Science. And thus the whole of Election dependes on the improvement of Free-wil, and the previſion thereof by this Middle Science. [2] It enervates and diſpirits the whole of Chriſts <hi>Redemtion;</hi> in that it makes al the efficace of Chriſts Death dependent on the previſion of mans aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and conſent to him as Lord. It ſuppoſeth that Chriſt died for no man abſolutely, but only on condition that men by their corrupt Wil embrace him. [3] It overthrows <hi>efficacious Grace</hi> in the vocation and converſion of ſinners; in that it reſolves al into a moral capacitie or power in corrupt Nature to convert it ſelf. [4] It ſubvertes the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> in reſolving the whole of it into a Covenant of Workes. [5] It deſtroyes the Grace of <hi>Perſeverance;</hi> in that it makes the perſeverance of the Saints dependent on their own mutable Free-wil.</p>

And indeed he ſeems poſitively to aſſert, <hi>Parmenid. p.</hi> 134. <hi>That the Origine of theſe Ideas cannot be in the object, but muſt be in the Divine Eſſence and Wil.</hi> We ſhall reduce the whole of our Philoſophemes about the Divine Wil to the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>God primarily Wils himſelf, and althings elſe in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to himſelf.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Object of the Divine Wil.</note> (1.) <hi>That the Divine Eſſence is the primary object of the Divine Wil.</hi> is moſt evident; [1.] becauſe the principal thing willed is to every one the cauſe of willing: if therefore God ſhould have any other principal object of his Wil beſides himſelf, he ſhould have ſomething beſides himſelf as the cauſe of his willing;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42100:190"/>which is impoſſible: for nothing can move the Divine Wil but his own Bonitie. [2] The Divine Eſſence is moſt <hi>amabile</hi> and <hi>appetible</hi> for it ſelf, therefore the primary object of the Divine Wil. [3] The primary object of the Wil ought to be equally proportionable thereto: for the virtue and efficace of a facultie is meaſured by its commenſuration and Adequation to its prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry object: and what is equally proportionable to the Divine Wil, but the Divine Eſſence? Hence, (2) <hi>God by willing himſelf, wils althings elſe in ſubordination to himſelf.</hi> For he that wils an end, wils althings elſe in order thereto. God wils althings in order to his own Bonitie: The Wil of God terminates on other things ſo far as they relate to the Divine Bonitie, and participate thereof: God wils himſelf <hi>Neceſſarily,</hi> but althings elſe ſo far as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to himſelf. Hence (1) <hi>God wils al ſingular Goods, ſo far as they partake of goodneſs.</hi> For God willing himſelf as his laſt end, wils althings ſo far as they conduce to himſelf: but every thing ſo far as it is good participates of, and tends to the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: therefore as ſuch it is willed by God. Hence,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>The Wil of God conſidered in it ſelf is but one, ſimple, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible, pure Act.</hi>

                        </gap>, <hi>one idea of althings.</hi> Whereby he notes, that the Divine Wil, as the origine of all things, is but one. The multitude of objects willed is no way repuguant with the Unitie and Simplicitie of the Divine Wil: for God by one ſimple act wils himſelf and althings elſe. Althings are one in the Divine Wil and Bonitie; in as much as the Divine Bonitie is the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar of al Bonitie; and the Divine Wil by one and the ſame act wils both the Divine Bonitie and al other Bonitie. It is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the Humane Wil, which by one act wils the end, and by another, the means conducing to the end: whence the willing the end is the cauſe of willing the means: but in the Divine Wil there is no ſuch cauſalitie of end and means to be found; in as much as by one and the ſame ſimple act it wils both end and means: and al grant, that the ſame thing cannot be the cauſe of it ſelf. Thence <hi>Suaxez Metaple. Diſput.</hi> 30. §. 16. <hi>p.</hi> 127, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proves, <q>That Gods Wil is not a real power, but the laſt pure Act: for there is no receptive power in God: althings that are in God are as actual as his effence, and as pure from all Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie.</q> Hence,</p>

(2) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God <hi>morally dependent</hi> on any other. <hi>Moral</hi> dependence is founded in <hi>natural:</hi> where there is natural independence in an abſolute degree, there cannot be moral dependence in any degree: The rational Creature having a twofold relation to God, as a Creature, and as rational, hence he has a twofold dependence on God, one <hi>natural,</hi> the other <hi>moral:</hi> but God being independent as to his Eſſence, muſt neceſſarily alſo be independent as to <hi>Morals.</hi> Moral dependence is either <hi>Legal,</hi> or <hi>Final: Legal</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is, when an inferior dependes on the Laws, Remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or Diſtributions of any Superior. <hi>Final Dependence</hi> is, when an inferior dependes on ſome ſupreme laſt end. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wil is in neither regard dependent. [1] It is not <hi>legally</hi>
                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:42100:191"/>dependent; becauſe not ſubject to the law of any. The Divine Wil gives Laws to al Creatures, but receives Laws from none: yea, it hath no legal dependence on any meritorious acts of the Creature: God willeth nothing without himſelf, becauſe it is juſt; but it is therefore juſt, becauſe he wils it: The reaſons of good and evil extrinſec to the Divine Eſſence are al dependent on the Divine Wil either <hi>decernent</hi> or <hi>legiſlative.</hi> [2] The Divine Wil has no <hi>final</hi> dependence on any <hi>ſuperior end;</hi> becauſe its own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is its only end. The End is the Cauſe, Reaſon, or Motive of willing althings that conduce to the End: but now nothing can move the Wil of God, but his own Bonitie; which indeed is the ſame with his Wil and Eſſence: wherefore it cannot be properly ſaid to be the cauſe of his Wil; becauſe nothing is ſaid to be the cauſe of it ſelf. When Theologues affirme, <hi>That God wils one thing for another,</hi> they mean not, that the other thing is the cauſe or motive of the Divine Wil; but that God wils there ſhould be a cauſal connexion between the things willed. As God willed the Sun, Moon, and Stars ſhould be for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of fruits, and theſe for the uſe of man, &amp;c. Gods willing one thing for another notes a cauſal connexion between the things willed, but no cauſal influence on the Divine Wil:<note place="margin">Deus vult hoc propter hoc: non autem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter hoc vult hoc. Epheſ. 1.4, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>God wils this for that, yet for this he doth not wil that: i. e.</hi> God wils effects and cauſes; and that the effects are for the cauſes; yet he doth not wil the effects for the cauſes, as if the cauſes were the motives of his Wil. Thus we muſt underſtand that Text, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he has choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love.</hi> How are <hi>the Elect choſen in Chriſt?</hi> (1) Negatively, they are not choſen in Chriſt, as the meritorious Cauſe of Election; nor from a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Faith in Chriſt, as the motive of Divine Election, according to the Pelagian Hypotheſis. But (2) They are ſaid <hi>to be choſen in Chriſt,</hi> as their <hi>commun Head,</hi> that by him they might be made new Creatures, and ſo partakers both of Grace and Glorie. Chriſt and Faith have no cauſal influence on the Divine Wil; but the Divine Wil decrees, that Chriſt and Faith ſhould have a cauſal influence on Salvation. Thence it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his Wil.</hi> Here Chriſt is brought in as the meritorious, antecedent Cauſe of our Adoption, but as an effect and conſequent of Election: For ſo

                        <hi>by</hi> denotes, namely that Chriſt as Mediator is the effect of Predeſtination or Election, but the cauſe of our Adoption. This is ſtrongly argued by <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Praedeſtinatione Sanctorum.</hi> And ſurely if the Merits of Chriſt have no cauſal influence on the Wil of God, much leſſe can mans Faith or Merits influence the ſame. Thence he addes: <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his Wil:</hi> which argues the <hi>Independence</hi> of his Wil. Thus we ſee how God wils Chriſt and Faith for the Salvation of the Elect, and yet doth not wil the Salvation of the Elect for Chriſt and Faith as the moving cauſes of his Wil, which is moſt independent. So God wils both the means and the end; and the means for the end; yet he doth not for the end wil the means, as if the end did move him to wil the means. For in God the volition of one thing is not the cauſe of his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling another; becauſe there can no efficience of cauſe on effect, or dependence of effect on the cauſe be affirmed of the Divine Wil, which is but one ſimple indiviſible act both as to end and means; and therefore neither one nor t'other can be ſaid to move or influence the Divine Wil; albeit the ſame Divine Wil doth wil a cauſal connexion between the things willed: in which regard Scholaſtic Theologues aſſigne reaſons of the Divine Wil, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That the paſſive attingence of the Divine Wil in reſpect of one thing, is the cauſe of its paſſive attingence in regard of another thing, albeit neither the cauſe of the Divine Wil: i. e.</hi> to ſpeak <hi>natively</hi> and properly, God wils that one thing ſhal depend on another, yet the Divine Wil neither dependes on nor is moved by either Gods ſoverain independent Wil is ful of reaſons, as to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable dependence of the things willed, according to their ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations, yet there may not be the leaſt reaſon or ſhadow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſſigned as the cauſe or motive of the Divine Wil.

It's true, the things willed by God are oft under mutations; and God wils thoſe mutations; but with an immutable wil: the mutation reacheth not the wil of God, but only the things willed by God; who wils this thing ſhal be now, and the contrary afterward, without the leaſt alteration in his wil. A wil is then ſaid to be changed, when any begins to wil that, which he before nilled; or to nil that, which he before wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: which cannot be ſuppoſed to happen, but in caſe of ſome mutation in knowlege, or diſpoſition: but neither of theſe can be affirmed of God. (1) God is infinitely wiſe, and foreſees al contingences, circumſtances, and accidents that may happen; and therefore cannot alter his thoughts or purpoſes for want of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as we poor mortals frequently do. (2) Gods diſpoſition towards al objects is ever the ſame. (3) The human wil is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexious to mutations, from impotence and want of power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what we wil: but the Divine Wil is omnipotent and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 46.10. (4) If the Divine Wil were mutable, God could not have a certain previſion of future contingents: becauſe the certaintie of Gods previſion ſuppoſeth a certaintie of Divine Ideas and Decrees in the will of God: for Gods <hi>Science of Viſion</hi> or foreſight of things future ariſeth from his Wil, which gives althings their futurition. But it is objected from Scripture, <hi>That God is ſaid ſometimes to repent: and al repentance denotes a change of the wil.</hi> The Reſponſe is ſacile: when Scripture aſcribes repentance to God it is only improperly and in condeſcendence to our fragile capacitie, thereby to denote a change, not in the Wil of God, but in his diſpenſation towards the Creature, upon ſome change in the Creature: So upon the repentance of the <hi>Ninevites</hi> God repented, <hi>i. e.</hi> changed his diſpenſation towards them.

                        </gap> or <hi>complacence</hi> is not in the Death of ſinners ſimply as ſuch, but in this, that men turne from their ſins and live. But (3) our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reſponſe is this: God declares by theſe and ſuch like Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures his gratioſe propenſions and inclinations towards penitent ſinners: [1] Hereby to demonſtrate that intime and indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble connexion, which he has, according to his Evangelic Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, eſtabliſhed between ſincere Reppentance and Salvation. [2] That ſo theſe general Declarations and Invitations of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repent might prove an efficacious inſtrument of particular vocation and converſion to the Elect. For Gods Free Grace albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it be in it ſelf abſolute and particular; yet it is propoſed to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Indefinite and Univerſal Propoſitions, thereby the more efficaciouſly to allure and draw their hearts to the embracement thereof. [3] Hereby impenitent Sinners are left without al ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; in as much as God has ſo freely and cordially offered Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to them, would they but embrace the ſame. Al this implies no proper conditionate Wil in God, but only ſome conditions in the externe propoſitions and offers of his Grace; which God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers on the Elect. There are many Scriptures that ſpeak Gods
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:42100:194"/>Wil to be Abſolute.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.11.</note> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>That the purpoſe of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Election might ſtand, not of Workes,</hi> &amp;c. Where <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>That God wils nothing conditionally is evident (1) from the impoſſibilitie of ſuch a Wil in God. For if God wils any thing <hi>conditionally,</hi> he wils that condition alſo, or not: if he doth not wil the condition, then it is impoſſible that it ſhould be; and ſo God is ſaid to wil things on impoſſible conditions; and then by conſequence to wil things impoſſible; which is too great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche to be caſt on the Deitie: If God wils the condition, then he wils it either abſolutely or conditionally: if abſolutely, then his wil is abſolute: for to wil a thing conditionally, and yet to wil the condition abſolutely, is to wil the thing it ſelf abſolutely. If God wils the condition conditionally, then the condition of this later condition, conditionally: which opens the dore for a progreſſe into infinite. (2) If Gods Wil ſhould be conditionate, then it would hang in ſuſpenſe, and depend on the humane wil; and ſo it ſhould be in the power of the human wil to make void and fruſtrate the Divine Wil: yea the Divine Wil ſhould be more in the power of mans wil, than the wil of the moſt miſerable ſlave is in the power of his Lords wil. This deſtroys the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raintie and Independence of the Divine Wil. (3) To ſuppoſe the Divine Wil to be conditionate takes away the futurition of that thing it wils: for nothing can be future of it ſelf, without ſome cauſe of its futurition: and there can be no cauſe aſſigned why a thing ſhould paſſe from being only poſſible to future, but the Divine Wil. (4) To ſuppoſe a conditionate wil in God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the certaintie of Divine preſcience: for if the condition hang in ſuſpenſe, and be not willed by God, the thing willed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certainly known. (5) A conditionate wil aſcribes to God imperfection, in that it ſuppoſeth his wil to be incomplete, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficacious, paſſive, dependent, mutable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that albeit we exclude al conditions from the Divine Wil, yet we do not exclude them from the things willed: The things willed may be conditionate, and yet the Divine Wil abſolute.

That Gods Wil properly ſo termed is ever <hi>Antecedent</hi> and never <hi>Conſequent</hi> may be demonſtrated, (1) From the <hi>Eternitie</hi> of Gods wil. According to <hi>Plato,</hi> the Idea or Decree of the Divine Wil is ever <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>ſempiterne:</hi> Now if the wil of God and its Ideas be al eternal; then not any one of them can be conſequent to any act of the Creature, which is in time. (2) From the <hi>Simplicitie, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and <hi>Immutabilitie</hi> of the Divine Wil. A conſequent wil in God ſuppoſeth his Divine Wil to hang in ſuſpenſe, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the mutable ambulatorie wil of man: and is it poſſible, that the prime cauſe ſhould depend on, or be influenced by the inferior ſecond cauſe? What? muſt the Supreme Soverain Wil attend, yea ſubſerve the nods and becks of human created wil? The act of willing in God cannot depend on any act of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ſomething conſequent thereto; becauſe then as oft as the act of the creature is changed, the wil of God muſt be changed. (3) From the <hi>perfection</hi> of the Divine Wil. A conſequent wil in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:42100:195"/>God, as ſtated by the Jeſuites and their Followers, ſuppoſeth an Antecedent imperfect wil, conſiſting only in a natural <hi>Velleitie</hi> or imperfect inclination, which is unworthy of the moſt perfect wil. (4) From the <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of God. If God wils a thing antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to the act of the creature, which ſhal never be, then the wil of God is not Omnipotent; but in the power of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, either to fulfil or fruſtrate the ſame. And Oh! how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous are ſuch Sentiments to the Divine Omnipotent Wil? If Gods Wil be in the power of the Creature and dependent thereon, then it may be wholly fruſtrated as to al its counſels and decrees touching the rational world. (5) This diſtinction of the Divine Wil into Antecedent and Conſequent is contumelious to the <hi>Beatitude</hi> of God. For every one is ſo far bleſſed, as he has his wil fulfilled: To have our wils croſſed or fruſtrated is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by al no ſmal portion of miſerie: may we then imagine; that the Divine Wil properly ſo termed is ever fruſtrated? (6) This diſtinction of Gods wil into antecedent and conſequent is alſo injurious to his Bountie and goodneſſe. Sacred Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie compareth God to a liberal Prince, who deviſeth liberal things,<note place="margin">Eſa. 32.8.</note> and thereby eſtabliſheth his Throne, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 32.8. <hi>But the liberal deviſeth liberal things, and by liberal things he ſhal stand.</hi> It's ſpoken of Chriſt as Mediator, or the great King of <hi>Sion,</hi> as appears, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. who deviſeth al manner of liberal things, and thereby <hi>ſtands,</hi> or <hi>is eſtabliſhed</hi> on his Throne, as the word denotes in the Hebrew. Did not Chriſt keep open houſe and diſtribute al his gifts and good things liberally and freely, his Throne would not be eſtabliſhed; he would have no Subjects to fil up his Kingdome. But now the diſtinction of the Divine Wil into Antecedent and Conſequent cuts aſunder al the nerves and ligaments of Chriſts Liberalitie, in that it makes him to have an imperfect <hi>Antecedent</hi> wil towards al, but a <hi>Conſequent Wil</hi> towards none, but thoſe who can by their good merits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe his favor. This diſtinction of Gods Wil into Antecedent and Conſequent is excellently wel refuted by <hi>Gregor. Ariminenſis, Sent.</hi> 1. <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 46, 47. where he concludes thus: <q>Al the good things that we have are given us by God out of his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Grace: and this ſpeakes, that God wills them to us by <hi>an Antecedent Wil;</hi> becauſe no cauſe antecedes in us, but al our good things flow from his Bonitie.</q>

(1) If we conſider the divine Wil abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, ſo its perfection may be demonſtrated, from its Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, pure Actualitie, Eternitie, Immutabilitie, Omnipotence, &amp;c. as before. (2) If we conſider the divine Wil <hi>relatively,</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively,</hi> as compared with a create human or Angelic wil, ſo its perfection appears, (1) in this, that the divine Wil gives al Bonitie and goodneſſe to things; whereas every create wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth goodneſſe in things that it wils: every create wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes on, becauſe it's moved by, the goodneſſe of its object; but every create good dependes on the goodneſſe of the divine Wil. Hence there can be aſſigned no cauſe of the divine Wil, but what is in it ſelf: whereas every create wil has a formal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, cauſe and motive without it ſelf, whereby it is moved and influenced. (2) In the human wil the volition of the end is the cauſe of its willing the means: but in the divine Wil, both end and means are willed by one ſimple indiviſible pure Act. (3) In mans wil, Volition and Nolition are diſtinct Acts: <hi>not to wil</hi> in man implies a negation or ſuſpenſion of the wils act: but in God, by reaſon of the pure actualitie of his Nature, Nolition and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition are the ſame. We may not imagine, that the divine Wil is capable of any ſuſpenſion or negation of Act; but whatever he wils not that it be, that he wils that it be not: alſo whatever he wils not that it be not, that he wils that it be. (4) Mans wil is circumſcribed and limited by juſtice: he may not wil but what is juſt; but Gods Wil is not circumſcribed by any Laws of Juſtice: he doth not wil things, becauſe juſt; but they are therefore juſt, becauſe he wils them.<note place="margin">Quicquid Deus non vult ut fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, illud etiam vult ut non fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: item quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid non vult ut non fiat, id ipſum etiam vult ut fiat.</note> (5) Mans wil is limited as to the ſphere of its Activitie: he wils what he doth, but he cannot do al that he wils: termes of eſſence ſuppoſe termes of power and activitie.

                        <note place="margin">The Divine Wil most free.</note> Libertie being one of the ſupreme perfections that belong to an intelligent rational Creature, it may not be denied to the divine Wil. Yea nothing elſe could be free, if the divine Wil were not free; becauſe this is the firſt Principe of al Libertie: as take away the firſt Cauſe, you alſo deſtroy al ſecond Cauſes; ſo take away libertie from the divine Wil, you take it away alſo from al create wils. Libertie in the divine Wil is abſolute, precedent, and regulant; libertie in the human wil is conditionate, ſubſequent, and regulated. The firſt in every kind is the meaſure of al in that kind: now the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Libertie is the firſt in that kind, and therefore the grand Exemplar of al create Libertie. The moſt perfect Cauſe muſt neceſſarily have the moſt perfect mode of acting: but now God is the moſt perfect Cauſe: therefore he muſt have the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mode of acting: which is to act freely. Yea, the divine Wil is ſo infinitely free, as that it is moved by nothing without it ſelf: it has not ſo much as an end extrinſec to its own Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whereby it is moved: which kind of independent libertie no create wil may challenge. For every create wil, as it has a firſt Cauſe, whereby it is moved phyſically; ſo a laſt end, whereby it is moved morally: but the Libertie of the divine Wil is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent in both theſe regards; and therefore moſt ſupreme and perfect. The Libertie of the divine Wil may be conſidered as relating to the operations <hi>ad intra,</hi> or to thoſe <hi>ad extra.</hi> (1) The Libertie of the divine Wil as relating to the operations <hi>ad intra</hi> is only <hi>concomitant;</hi> not <hi>antecedent:</hi> for al the operations of God <hi>ad intra, i. e.</hi> ſuch as terminate on himſelf, namely loving himſelf, &amp;c. they are al from a neceſſitie of Nature, not from election and choice. God cannot but love himſelf: he neceſſarily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to his own Bonitie and enjoys himſelf, without the leaſt indifference either of <hi>Specification,</hi> or <hi>Exercice.</hi> And yet even in theſe Acts <hi>ad intra,</hi> which terminate on the divine Eſſence, and are attended with a natural neceſſitie, the divine Wil has a <hi>concomitant Libertie</hi> or divine <hi>Spontaneitie;</hi> which is ſufficient to denominate thoſe Acts free. For as the human wil adheres to its laſt end by a kind of natural neceſſitie, which yet is attended with a rational ſpontaneitie; ſo in like manner the divine Wil adheres to and enjoys it ſelf by a natural neceſſitie, and yet with a concomitant libertie or divine ſpontaneitie. This is wel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by <hi>Jamblichus,</hi> a Sectator of <hi>Plato, de Myſter. Aegypt.</hi> 
                        <q>It
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42100:197"/>is, ſaith he, neceſſary, that God be as he is, not by an extrinſec violent neceſſitie, but by a natural and moſt voluntary; ſeing he never would be other than he is.</q> Here we ſee the higheſt neceſſitie conſpiring and according with the higheſt libertie. (2) If we conſider the Libertie of the Divine Wil as relating to its operations <hi>ad extra,</hi> ſuch as terminate on the Creature, ſo it is not only <hi>concomitant,</hi> but alſo <hi>antecedent: i.e.</hi> the Divine Wil terminates on the Creature, not from any neceſſitie of Nature, but by <hi>election and choice.</hi> For al Creatures, as referred to the Divine Bonitie, are but means: wherefore the Divine Wil has an antecedent libertie either for the electing or refuſing of them. This ſome cal <hi>Libertie of Election;</hi> becauſe al election properly regards the means. Again, God in willing his own Bonitie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, wils althings ſo far as they participate of his own Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Now the divine Bonitie being infinite, there are infinite ways whereby the Creatures are participable thereof; but al depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the election and determination of the Divine Wil.

But to clear up this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we are to conſider, (1) That Gods decernent or decretive Wil is <hi>univocally</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> ſaid to be his Wil; but his <hi>voluntas ſigni</hi> or <hi>preceptive Wil</hi> is only <hi>equivocally,</hi> or <hi>analogically,</hi> and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively ſuch.

(1) Gods Wil reveled in his Word is either <hi>promiſſive</hi> or <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive:</hi> Reveled promiſſes are the meaſure of Gods Benefices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: Reveled precepts are the meaſure of our Offices or Duties towards God. (2) Gods reveled providential Wil is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>directive</hi> or <hi>afflictive.</hi> There is a conformitie, which the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature owes to each of theſe reveled wils of God: To
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42100:199"/>the wil of God reveled in his word there is an active conformitie or obedience due; to the promiſſive reveled wil there is an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith due, to the preceptive an obedience of love and ſubjection. To the providential wil of God both <hi>directive</hi> and <hi>afflictive</hi> there is a <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience of <hi>Submiſſion, Reſignation</hi> and <hi>Dependence</hi> due. Laſtly, this reveled wil of God is never oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to, albeit it be oft diverſe from, his ſecret wil; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe they are not about the ſame object: Gods ſecret wil regards the events of things, his reveled wil the duty of man, either active or paſſive.</p>

Whence if any actions agree to God, which paſſe not into ſome fact or effect, but remain in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; there can no power be affirmed as to ſuch actions; more than according to our manner of underſtanding, not in truth. Such as are the actions of Underſtanding and Willing, which implie no power in God. The Power therefore of God, to ſpeak properly, reſpectes not ſuch actions, but only effects.</q> And the reaſon is evident; becauſe power in God is the ſame with his Eſſence, and therefore a pure Act, not diſtinct from the ſecond Act, but only from the Effect.</p>
                     <p>Albeit the Power of God be in it ſelf one and the ſame,<note place="margin">Gods abſolute Power.</note> yet for our more diſtinct conception of it we may diſtinguiſh it into <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,</hi> and <hi>ordinate</hi> or <hi>actual.</hi> (1) Gods <hi>abſolute Power</hi> is that whereby he is conſidered as ſimply potent to effect althings poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, although they never ſhal be: as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. &amp; 26.53. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.27. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20.

This Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, <hi>touching the Identitie of Gods executive Power with his Wil,</hi> has been avouched and defended by the moſt acute Scholaſtic Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.

For (1) if there were any thing more required, to the production of an effect, than the Divine Wil, it would thence follow, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wil is not of it ſelf ſufficient to act, contrary to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Textes. (2) It's evident, that the Wil of God is in ſome manner operative of it ſelf, even as our wils are in moving our own bodies. And if the Divine Wil be in one degree operative, why not in every degree? Doth it need any executive virtue for the ſupplie of its deficience? Is it not omnipotent? (3) If any ſuch executive power be placed in God, it muſt naturally me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate between the Divine Wil and effect: but this cannot be, becauſe the effect neceſſarily follows upon the Divine Volition. The ſame Hypotheſis is defended by <hi>Alvarez, de Auxil. l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 129. <hi>concluſ.</hi> 1. <q>We may not place in God, beſides his Intellect and Wil, any third executive power eminently or formally diſtinct for the production of things.</q> But of this more in Gods Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. §. 3. <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. &amp; §. 5. <hi>Prop.</hi> 4.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The object of Gods Power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> For every power muſt have ſome object adequate thereto: and by how much the higher and more univerſal the power is, by ſo much the more univerſal is the object: and is not the active power of God
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:42100:201"/>the firſt Cauſe moſt ſupreme and univerſal? Muſt it not then comprehend under its object al poſſible Entitie? And the more fully to underſtand this, we are to underſtand, that a thing may be ſaid to be poſſible two ways: (1) <hi>Poſitively:</hi> and ſo that is poſſible, which may be produced by a power. Things poſſible are not ſaid in this ſenſe to be the object of Gods power: for then the ſame thing would be explicated by it ſelf: for to ſay the power of God is extended to althings poſitively poſſible, is the ſame as if we ſhould ſay, it is extended to al ſuch things as are by it denominated poſſible. Wherefore (2) a thing may be ſaid to be poſſible <hi>negatively,</hi> in a way of non-repugnance, as it implies not any repugnance of exiſting: and ſo althings are poſſible which implie not a contradiction. And in this ſenſe things poſſible are ſaid to be the object of Gods infinite Power;<note place="margin">What things are impoſſible.</note> which extendes it ſelf to whatever implies not a contradiction or repugnance of exiſting. For, in as much as nothing is more repugnant to <hi>Ens</hi> than <hi>non Ens, Ens</hi> and <hi>non Ens</hi> being contradictories, it thence follows, that whatever involves a contradiction cannot come within the comprehenſion of <hi>Ens</hi> poſſible, <hi>poſſible Being,</hi> but muſt be ſimply and of it ſelf impoſſible. God cannot verifie contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; becauſe they have not a paſſive power or poſſibilitie of being verified: for the affirming of the one is the denying of the other: they cannot be both true; becauſe they ſhould not be contradictions, if the truth of the one did not neceſſarily make the other falſe. That what involves a contradiction comes not within the latitude of the object of Gods power, is not from any defect of power in God; but becauſe the thing has not in it ſelf any poſſibilitie of exiſting, or of being reduced into act: for no power can be denominated ſuch in relation to a terme or effect, which implies an impoſſibilitie of exiſting; as what is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie doth. Al power extendes it ſelf to that which can be actuated thereby: as al ſenſitive power is converſant about ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible objects, ſo far as they may be actuated thereby: ſo the power of God is converſant about al poſſible things, ſo far as they are capable of being actuated thereby. Whence it appears, that the impoſſibilitie of contradictions ariſeth from the incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the mater, not from any defect in the power of God.</p>
                     <p>Now the impoſſibles which implie a repugnance of being done by God, are either ſuch as regard <hi>God himſelf,</hi> or the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>both.</hi> 1. The <hi>Impoſſibles that regard God himſelf</hi> are either
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:42100:202"/>
                        <hi>abſolutely</hi> ſuch, or only in ſome <hi>limited ſenſe.</hi> (1) The <hi>Impoſſibles,</hi> which regard God himſelf <hi>abſolutely,</hi> are al ſuch as are ſimply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Divine Eſſence. As God cannot deceive or be deceived: he cannot ſin, or be the moral cauſe of ſin: he cannot condemne or puniſh, (though he may afflict yea torment) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, or juſtifie the wicked without a ſatisfaction. (2) The <hi>Impoſſibles</hi> that regard God in a limited ſenſe, are ſuch as implie a <hi>certain mode of acting,</hi> or <hi>a certain Hypotheſis</hi> repugnant to the Divine Eſſence. [1] Such as implie <hi>a certain mode of acting;</hi> as God cannot exert the natural or vital acts of an animal bodie: he cannot <hi>eat, drinke, ſpeak,</hi> &amp;c. in that mode we do, &amp;c. [2] The Impoſſibles under a <hi>certain Hypotheſis</hi> repugnant to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, are ſuch as theſe: not to do what he has decreed, or promiſed. 2. The <hi>Impoſſibles which regard the Creature,</hi> or the externe object of Gods power, are ſuch as deſtroy the eſſence of the object. Thus God cannot make a Creature independent, or not to depend on himſelf, both as to Being and Operation. For dependence is eſſential to a Creature: and therefore to ſuppoſe a Creature not to depend on God as wel in Operation as Being, is to ſuppoſe a Creature not to be a Creature, as <hi>Suarez</hi> ſtrongly demonſtrates againſt the Hypotheſis of <hi>Durandus,</hi> who denies Gods concurſe to the material act of ſin. Again, to ſuppoſe that God in the Euchariſt ſhould <hi>Tranſubſtantiate</hi> or commute the Bread into the Bodie of Chriſt, and yet the <hi>Quantitie</hi> and <hi>viſible Accidents</hi> of the Bread ſtil remain, implies a contradiction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Quantitie or <hi>Extenſion</hi> is eſſential to a bodie. Beſides, this Popiſh Hypotheſis of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> implies other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, in that it ſuppoſeth two bodies to be in the ſame place or ſpace, and the ſame bodie of Chriſt to be in two places at once, &amp;c. In like manner we ſay God cannot, according to the Lutheran <hi>Conſubstantiation,</hi> make the bodie of Chriſt to be at the ſame time in the Heavens, and circumſcribed thereby, and yet in and with, and under the Bread. 3. <hi>Things impoſſible both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gand of God and the Creature</hi> are ſuch as are repugnant to the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of both. Thus God cannot, by his infinite Power, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an effect equal to himſelf, infinite in Eſſence: For by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an effect infinite, he ſhould make his own Eſſence finite: it is as eſſential to al products of God to be finite, as it is to God to be infinite, as <hi>Suarez, Metaph, Diſput.</hi> 30. <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. <hi>pag.</hi> 147.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>his power is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi> or omnipotent. This omnipotence of God, or the extenſion of his Divine Power to althings poſſible, may be thus demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: (1) Every perfect Virtue doth extend it ſelf to thoſe things, unto which its proper effect can extend it ſelf: but now the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Gods Power extends it ſelf to whatever is poſſible: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Power of God muſt be as extenſive. (2) Every Paſſive Power has ſome Active Power adequate and commenſurate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: for every Power is for its act; as the mater is for the forme, according to the <hi>Ariſtoteleans.</hi> Whatever therefore is in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or obediential power of a create Being, al that God can by his active power actuate, and accompliſh. (3) The mode of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Power in every Agent, is according to the perfection of its nature or eſſence: But now Gods eſſence being the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42100:203"/>pure Act containing in it al perfection, hence it neceſſarily follows, that his active virtue muſt extend it ſelf to althings ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any perfection, <hi>i. e.</hi> which implie not a contradiction or repugnance of exiſting. See <hi>Aquinas, Contra Gent. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows,<note place="margin">Gods Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</note> that Gods Power is <hi>Infinite.</hi> (1) The magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of power anſwers in proportion to the magnitude of eſſence: whence, where there are no termes of eſſence, there can be no termes of power. Eſſence and Power in God are the ſame: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eſſence being infinite, his Power alſo muſt be ſo. Crea tures are limited in their Eſſence, and therefore in their Power: but the great God having no termes to his Eſſence can admit none as to his power. What can be too difficult for the Divine Power, which brought al things out of nothing? When the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees</hi> douted of the Reſurrection, our Lord reſolves their Error into an ignorance of the Power of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.29.</note> 
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. intimating thereby, that the Power of God was Infinite, and could extend it ſelf to al effects. Thus <hi>Aquinas, Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Q.</hi> 25. <hi>a.</hi> 2. <q>It's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Active Power of God be Inſinite: for by how much the more perfect the forme of any Agent is, by ſo much the greater is his power in acting: whence the Divine Eſſence (whereby God acts) being Infinite, his Power alſo muſt be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. The like he addes, <hi>Contra Gent. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 43. Every thing acts according to its forme, which is its Eſſence, or a part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</q> Whence Gods Eſſence being Infinite, his Power alſo is ſuch. (2) The Infinitude of Gods Power may be demonſtrated from the manner of his working in creating things: where the paſſive Power is infinitely low, the active Power muſt be infinitely high: but now in Creation the paſſive Power is in a laxe ſenſe infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly low, in that it is purely nothing; thence Gods active Power muſt be infinitely high. (3) It muſt, according to Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be granted, that there is in the Univerſitie of Beings a power, than which nothing can be conceived greater: and to whom doth this Prerogative belong but to God? And if we can conceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater than God, muſt we not alſo conceive him to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in Power? for may we not conceive ſomething greater than al finite Power?

They who denie Gods abſolute Dominion over the Creatures, denie him to be their Creator. Muſt we not allow God, who made althings, a power to order al to the ends he made them for? Doth not God give to every Creature what ſhape he pleaſeth? and may he not then appoint them to what end he pleaſe? Is it not an end ſufficient for the Being of a Creature to be the objective glorie of any Divine Attribute? And therefore if God ſhould make an innocent Creature to deſtroy it, thereby to illuſtrate the Glorie of his Power, who can ſay he is unjuſt? The greateſt notions that our minds can frame are too narrow to expreſſe the abſolute Dominion of God over his Creature.</p>

                        <hi>by reaſon of his abſolute Juſtice and Dominion, could, if it had-ſeemed good to him, have freely pardoned ſinners without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi> And here I find my ſelf involved in that grand Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Whether the vindictive or punitive Juſtice of God, as to its egreſſes, be neceſſary?</hi> I am not ignorant that great and holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are divided in their thoughts and determinations hereof: Some ſtrongly defending the Affirmative; others the Negative. I may not be ſo far mine own flaterer, as to preſume my ſelf to be capable of reconciling ſuch extremes, yet may I not humbly offer ſomewhat tending thereto? And firſt we muſt diſtinguiſh the termes, and then we ſhal with more facilitie determine the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo as to include the ſenſe of both extremes. We muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, (1) between <hi>the merit of puniſhment,</hi> and <hi>the actual adjudging ſinners unto puniſhment.</hi> (2) Between <hi>the obligation on God to puniſh,</hi> and <hi>the obligation on the ſinner to receive puniſhment.</hi> (3) Between <hi>Natural Neceſſitie</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi> (4) Between <hi>natural Congruitie</hi> and <hi>natural Neceſſitie.</hi> (5) Between <hi>Gods abſolute Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Dominion,</hi> and his <hi>ordinate Juſtice.</hi> Theſe diſtinctions premiſſed, we offer theſe following Propoſitions for the determining the queſtion and reconciling the extremes. (1) Prop. <hi>Al ſin neceſſarily me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits puniſhment, albeit actual punition be not an effect abſolutely and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:42100:205"/>phyſically neceſſary for the vindication of Divine Juſtice.</hi> Al ſin has guilt neceſſarily appendent thereto: and al guilt neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a merit of puniſhment: for guilt is but a middle between ſin and puniſhment; it neceſſarily follows ſin, and bindes over the ſinner, or makes him obnoxious unto puniſhment: yet actual pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition is not abſolutely neceſſary for the vindication of Divine Juſtice. (2) Prop. <hi>There is a neceſſary debt or obligation on the ſinners part to receive puniſhment, albeit there be not a debt or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation abſolutely and phyſically neceſſary on Gods part to puniſh the ſinner.</hi> Guilt is not a <hi>phyſic</hi> but <hi>moral Accident;</hi> or <hi>mode,</hi> or <hi>debt</hi> improperly ſo termed, whereby the offender is bound over to ſuffer ſuch puniſhment, as the merit of the ſin requires: whence on Gods part it implies a certain moral right or power of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing: not that God is bound by a neceſſitie of nature to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, although the ſinner be bound by a neceſſary obligation of his nature to receive and ſuffer puniſhment. Hence, (3) <hi>God has a natural right to puniſh ſin, yet he doth not puniſh it from a neceſſitie of nature, but freely.</hi> God moſt juſtly puniſheth ſin, yet he would not be unjuſt, if we conſider his abſolute Juſtice, if he did not puniſh it. If Gods puniſhing ſin be from a <hi>neceſſitie of nature,</hi> and not from the <hi>free conſtitution</hi> of his Wil, he muſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin as neceſſarily, as he loves himſelf: and then it wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that God cannot relaxate his penal Laws, as to the time, meaſure, and manner of puniſhing: yea he cannot accept of the ſatisfaction of a Mediator: for that is a degree of relaxation. It's true, God neceſſarily loves his own Glorie which is darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſin: but yet it is not Gods <hi>eſſential</hi> Glorie, but only his <hi>manifeſtative</hi> Glorie which is hurt by ſin, as <hi>Elihu, Job</hi> 39.6. Hence Gods puniſhing ſin is not from a <hi>neceſſitie of nature,</hi> ſuch as that whereby the fire burnes, or God loves himſelf: For in al the Acts of God <hi>ad extra</hi> there is not only a <hi>concomitant</hi> but alſo <hi>antecedent Libertie,</hi> or <hi>Libertie of Election,</hi> which ſuppoſeth ſome poſſibilitie of rejection, at leaſt according to the prioritie of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or nature, as before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 3.8. <hi>Prop.</hi> Whence Gods puniſhing ſin being an act <hi>ad extra</hi> dependent on the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his Wil, it cannot be from a neceſſitie of nature. (4) <hi>Albeit, God be not under a natural neceſſitie of puniſhing ſin, yet he is under a moral neceſſitie to puniſh the ſame.</hi> By <hi>moral neceſſitie</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that moral obligation he is under for the vindication of his Juſtice as Rector of the World.

(5) Laſtly, <hi>Albeit God might, by his abſolute Dominion, conſidered antecedently to his Wil, let ſin paſſe unpuniſhed, yet by his ordinate Juſtice, he neceſſarily puniſheth the ſame.</hi> In the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods moral efficience on his Creature, we are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what God can by his <hi>abſolute Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi> do, but what by his <hi>ordinate Juſtice</hi> and <hi>moral Conſtitution</hi> he can do. And in this regard it is moſt true, that God is under a neceſſitie of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſin, without a ſatisfaction: and he were inevitably unjuſt, if he ſhould not puniſh it. And thus, as I humbly conceive, both opinions, though ſeemingly oppoſite, may be eaſily reconciled. And indeed we find this very Controverſie on foot many hundred years ſince. For <hi>Auguſtin</hi> held, <hi>That God could ſave ſinners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſatisfaction:</hi> and <hi>Anſelme</hi> held, <hi>he could not.</hi> And <hi>Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 52. <hi>pag.</hi> 841. undertakes my taske, to reconcile both, by the diſtinction of <hi>Gods abſolute Power,</hi> and his <hi>ordinate Power,</hi> as Rector of the World. In the former ſenſe he can, but in the later he cannot ſave ſinners but by Chriſt. Hence,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We paſſe on to Gods <hi>ordinate Juſtice,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gods ordinate Justice from his Wil.</note> which has a neceſſary relation to ſome qualitie in its object, in this or that manner <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> or <hi>conſtituted;</hi> which qualitie being ſuppoſed, its egreſſe to or execution on its object is neceſſary, not by any <hi>phyſic</hi> neceſſitie of nature, but by a <hi>moral</hi> neceſſitie or natural congruitie, ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the free conſtitution of the Divine Wil, in order to the manifeſtation of the Divine Glorie. And in this ſenſe the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, in ſacred Philoſophie, is uſually taken, namely for that Attribute whereby God executes the Decrees and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of his own ſoverain Wil and Word, for the manifeſtation of his own Glorie. So that this <hi>ordinate Juſtice of God</hi> implies ſeveral particular Ideas, which we ſhal endeavor to explicate in the following Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>Gods ordinate Juſtice ariſeth from the free Conſtitution and Determination of his own Wil.</hi> Antecedently to the Wil of God nothing is ſo far juſt, that it ought to be, but only that it may be juſtly and conveniently done, if God wil it: there is no Law of Juſtice in the actions of God, but what his own Wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth: the Wil of God is not circumſcribed by his Juſtice, but his Juſtice by his Wil: for nothing is juſt in Divine Actions, but what he wils, yea becauſe he wils it. Thus <hi>Carthuſianus, in</hi>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:42100:206"/>4. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 46. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>The whole order of Juſtice is originally reduced to the Divine Wil: whatever God wils is juſt, neither is his Wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly reſtrained by Juſtice.</hi> So <hi>Scotus, l.</hi> 4. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 46. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>That is always just, which is actually willed by the Divine Wil; and becauſe it is actually willed by the Divine Wil.</hi> The Rule of Juſtice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are to act, ties them up to one part of the contradiction, ſo that they are unjuſt if they act not ſo; but there is no ſuch Rule of Juſtice to be affixed to God, farther than the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his own Wil has tied him up. Gods Wil reveled is a Rule of Juſtice to us his Creatures, but his abſolute ſoverain Wil is that alone that regulates him in al his actions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learned <hi>Davenant</hi> ſaith, <q>That God cannot wil any thing but <hi>ſalvâ juſtitiâ, i. e.</hi> he can do nothing <hi>contra justitiam;</hi> yet he may wil and do many things <hi>praeter juſtitiam: i. e.</hi> he may freely decree and do many things, where <hi>ſalvâ juſtitiâ,</hi> he might as freely have decreed and done the contrary.</q> So <hi>Lombard. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 43. <hi>God could have omitted what he doth, and have done what he omits, without injuſtice.</hi> Hence,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>Gods ordinate Juſtice towards the Creature has one and the ſame Idea with his Veracitie or Fidelitie.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gods ordinate Justice the ſame with his Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. <hi>Pſal. 119.123.</hi>
                        </note> Thence in ſacred Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie the Righteouſneſſe of God is oft put for his Veracitie and Fidelitie in making good his word. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.123. <hi>For the word of thy righteouſneſſe: i. e.</hi> the word of thy promiſſe, which thy righteouſneſſe or fidelitie is obliged to make good. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.1. &amp; 89.14. There is indeed in God no Juſtice properly ſo termed, in which reſpect he may be ſaid to be obliged to his Creature: but that which we ſtile the Juſtice of God towards his Creature, is no other than his <hi>Fidelitie,</hi> which preſuppoſeth ſome conſtitution of the Divine Wil: wherefore, abſtracting ſuch a conſtitution, God cannot be ſaid to do any thing repugnant to his Juſtice. For what is Juſtice, according to its general Idea, but <hi>to give every one his own?</hi> And what has the Creature that it may claim as its own, but what it receives from the Divine Wil? Again, Juſtice is a <hi>Conformitie</hi> or <hi>Equalitie,</hi> according to the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or debt which every one fals under:<note place="margin">Juſtitia Dei eſt agere ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiam Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis aut Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatis ſuae. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert. p.</hi> 1. <hi>tract.</hi> 19. <hi>q.</hi> 77.</note> and what obligation or debt can there befal God, with relation to his Creature, but what his own goodneſſe and wil laies upon him? How can God be obliged to any, but by his own wil and word? What then is his Juſtice, but <hi>to act according to the condecence or congruitie of his own Veracitie or Bonitie,</hi> as the Schole-men determine? Hence in
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42100:207"/>things where there is no expreſſe declaration of the Divine Wil, Covenant, or Promiſſe on God part, if he ſhould pretermit that which he doth, or do that which he pretermits, if he ſhould deal more ſeverely, or more mercifully with any than he doth, there could be no injuſtice faſtened on him. Hence,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Prop. <hi>There can be no</hi>

                        <hi>or Acception of perſons charged on God.</hi> This is expreſſely laid down, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.11. of which before: And the reaſons are moſt evident, (1) Becauſe <hi>Acception of perſons</hi> has place only in him, who is under an obligation to diſtribute juſtice, not according to his pleaſure, but according to certain <hi>Qualities, Reaſons,</hi> or <hi>Conditions</hi> inherent in or appendent to the perſons, to whom the ſaid juſtice is to be diſtributed. But now God is under no obligation, but what flows from his own ſoverain pleaſure, to diſtribute rewards or puniſhments to any. (2) <hi>Acception of perſons</hi> cannot have place in the diſtribution of good things merely gratuitous and free; but only in ſuch as are of debt: But now Gods diſtributions of good things are merely gratuitous. Thus <hi>Aquinas: Acception of perſons is only of a thing due; and therefore it cannot be aſcribed to God.</hi> None can owe any thing to another, but by this, that he doth in ſome manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on, or hath received ſomething from another: but God dependes on no one, neither doth he receive any thing from any other. Acception of perſons has place only where, in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of things due, any favors one more than another, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome circumſtance of the perſon, contrary or beſide the merits of the cauſe. Therefore, albeit God give, out of his mere liberalitie, inequally to perſons equal, yet this is not <hi>Acception of perſons;</hi> becauſe there is nothing due. Hence,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Prop. <hi>There is an infinite diſtance between the Juſtice of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The difference between the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God and Men.</note> 
                        <hi>and of men.</hi> (1) Al human Juſtice ariſeth from an obligation and debt; but Gods Juſtice from the mere free conſtitution of his Wil: Man wils things, becauſe they are juſt; but things are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſt with God, becauſe he wils them. (2) Many things that are injuſt with men, are juſt with God. The rule of Juſtice which tieth men to do juſtly, doth alſo render them injuſt, when they do otherwiſe: But now God, where he hath not brought himſelf under an obligation by his own free conſtitution and promiſſe, hath a libertie of acting or not acting, of doing this or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the diſtribution of rewards, and gifts. If he ſhould not do what he doth, or if he ſhould do what he doth not, his Juſtice
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:42100:207"/>were the ſame. If God ſpoil the Egyptians to enrich his people, or if he enrich the Aſſyrians by the ſpoils of his people, he is juſt ſtil. Where God hath not obliged himſelf by his own Word, he has a libertie of doing one thing or the contrary without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Yet,</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Prop. <hi>So far as God hath obliged himſelf by the conſtitution of his own Wil and Word,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gods Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> 
                        <hi>his ordinate Juſtice ever regardes the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Qualities of the object.</hi> Gods ordinate Juſtice being the ſame with his Veracitie and Fidelitie, it alwaies reſpects ſuch Qualities and Conditions as its object, by reaſon of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, is inveſted with. For God, in the executions of his ordinate Juſtice, aſſumes the qualitie of a Judge: and a Judge cannot duely abſtain from the adminiſtration of Juſtice: neither is Juſtice duely adminiſtred, unleſſe the Qualities of the objects, and merits of the cauſe be fully inſpected and conſidered. Gods ordinate Juſtice as <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> of the Al is chiefly exerciſed in the reduction of althings to that equalitie and order, which his Divine Wiſdome and Wil has preſcribed unto them. Hence theſe two things neceſſarily follow this Divine ordinate Juſtice: (1) It never exerts it ſelf, but where thoſe Qualities and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which it has preſcribed its object, be found. As it never puniſheth any but for ſin; ſo it never rewards any but the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2) Whereever theſe Conditions or Qualities are found, it neceſſarily exerts it ſelf. It cannot but puniſh ſin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be; neither can it but reward holineſs if ſincere. There is a neceſſitie, not <hi>Phyſic</hi> but <hi>Moral</hi> attendes al its egreſſes; and that from the free Conſtitution of the Divine Wil.</p>
                     <p>§. 2. Next to the Juſtice of God we are to diſcourſe of his <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racitie</hi> and <hi>Fidelitie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gods Veracitie and Fidelitie.</note> which is not really diſtinct from his <hi>Ordinate Juſtice.</hi> Thence we find the Juſtice of God frequently put for his Fidelitie. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.1. <hi>Deliver me in thy Righteouſneſſe,</hi>

And in this regard the <hi>Truth</hi> of God importes the veritie of his Ideas, or knowlege of things. [2] Simple Truth <hi>in Things,</hi> is nothing but <hi>their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to their ſpecific Idea,</hi> or <hi>formal definition and nature.</hi> So we ſay, that is true Gold, which conformes to the ſpecific Idea of Gold.

[2] <hi>Complexe Oral Veritie</hi> is either <hi>Logic</hi> or <hi>Ethic: Logic Oral Veritie</hi> is when Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions or Diſcourſes agree with things: <hi>Ethic Oral Veritie</hi> is when our words agree to our thoughts, which is termed <hi>Sinceritie;</hi> or our deeds to our words, which is <hi>Veracitie.</hi>

                     <p>This Veracitie as to God regards al his words;<note place="margin">Gods Veracitie in fulfilling</note> but in a more particular manner his <hi>Comminations</hi> or <hi>Threats,</hi> and <hi>Promiſſes;</hi> yet with this difference.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>(1)</hi> Promiſſes.</note> (1) <hi>Promiſſes</hi> give a right to the perſons to whom they are made, which cannot be taken from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injurie: for albeit it be free to any to make a promiſſe; yet having made it, his fidelitie is obliged to ſee it performed.

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42100:209"/>when they are confirmed by an Oath, which renders them every way Immutable and Irrelaxable. Such are al the Promiſſes of God, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.17.<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17, 18.</note> Where God is ſaid to confirme his promiſſe by an Oath, whereby it became every way immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.

                           <hi>(2)</hi> Threats.</note> there is no right or debt accrews to the perſons, to whom they are made, ſave only a debt or merit of puniſhment: the threat ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them obnoxious to puniſhment, if they break that Law whereto the threat is appendent: yet in many Caſes, 'ſpecially as to circumſtances, the Superior, who made the Law and affixed a threat thereto, has a libertie of relaxing, or diſpenſing with the penaltie of his Law. The Commination declares the <hi>Merit</hi> of puniſhment in the offender, and the <hi>Power</hi> of puniſhing in the Superior offended; but yet it doth not alwaies ſuppoſe a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie egreſſe or execution of vindictive juſtice for the puniſhing the offender; at leaſt not as to al circumſtances threatned; but ſtil there remains place in the breaſt of the Judge, or Superior, 'ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be Abſolute, and Soverain, either to relaxe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the penaltie of his Laws, either in whole or part. Thus in Gods Threats and penal Laws, he reſerves to himſelf a libertie of Relaxation or Diſpenſation in many Caſes, thereby to make way for his Clemence or Mercie, without the leaſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Veracitie or Juſtice. So in the firſt commination or penal Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Thou <hi>ſhalt ſurely die.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> Heb. <hi>in dying thou ſhalt die.</hi> Which Hebraiſme denotes a <hi>certain, immediate, perfect,</hi> and <hi>conſtant death.</hi> And yet our Soverain Lord, out of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verain rich Mercie, was pleaſed very far to relaxe and mitigate the rigor of this commination or penal Law, as to many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by admitting of a Mediator, and new Evangelic Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. In this regard God is ſaid to <hi>repent</hi> or turne from the ſierceneſſe of wrath, as Jonah 3.9. <hi>Who can tel if God wil turne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jonah 3.9.</note> 
                        <hi>and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not.</hi> God by reaſon of their legal imperfect faith and repentance, turned away his fierce wrath for that time, albeit afterward it came down with vengeance, as Hiſtorie aſſureth us. Neither is it to be feared, leſt the <hi>Veracitie</hi> of God ſhould receive any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie, if al his Threats are not alwaies in al circumſtances or parts fulfilled: becauſe al comminations and threats, which have not ſome character or ſigne of irrevocabilitie aſſixt to them, are, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own nature, ſo to be underſtood, as not to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42100:210"/>the right of the Superior, who makes them, to relaxe the ſame. Thus we ſee what latitude the Divine Veracitie admits in the fulfilling Comminations and Threats, beyond what can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in fulfilling Divine Promiſſes, as <hi>Grotius</hi> wel obſerves.</p>
                     <p>Gods <hi>Veracitie</hi> and <hi>Fidelitie</hi> in fulfilling his word,<note place="margin">Gods Veracitie demonſtrated.</note> is founded in and may be demonſtrated by, (1) his <hi>eſſential Veritie. Plato</hi> makes God to be <gap reason="foreign">

God is Truth <hi>eſſentially,</hi> not <hi>participatively,</hi> therefore nothing but Truth can paſſe from him. Again, God is <hi>pure Truth</hi> or <hi>Veritie,</hi> with whom not the leaſt ſhadow of <hi>Falſitie, Hypocriſie,</hi> or <hi>Fraude</hi> in word or deed can mingle. Pure Truth and falſitie are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible. There are no thoughts or ideas of mans heart ſo true, but there is ſome mixture of error or falſitie in them: no words or deeds ſo ſincere and faithful, but ſomething of hypocrifie and falſitie mixed with them: becauſe there is no pure truth in mans thoughts or words. But God being the <hi>first, pure, eſſential Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> his Veracitie is moſt pure and perfect, without the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of falſitie. (2) Gods Veracitie is founded on, and may be demonſtrated by his <hi>Eternitie and Omnipotence.</hi> Thus in ſacred Philoſophie,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.29.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. <hi>The Eternitie or ſtrength of Iſrael wil not lie.</hi> Al lies are from impotence and infirmitie: Truth and Veracitie is ever potent and ſtrong; but falſitie moſt impotent. (3) From the Holineſſe of God, of which we ſhal immediately diſcourſe. I ſhal conclude this Divine Attribute with a pleaſing obſervation I long ſince met with in the Life of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ipre,</hi> that great Patron of Divine Grace, who being demanded, <hi>What Attribute of God was most in his heart, whereby he was most awed?</hi> Replied, <hi>The Truth or Veracitie of God.</hi> And he that writes his Life, prefixed to his <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That in his Garden-walkes, and ſolitary Meditations, with his eyes fixed on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he was oft ſeen and heard to break forth into this acclamation: O Truth!</hi> So great an Admirer was he of Divine <hi>Veritie</hi> and <hi>Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie:</hi> and indeed no wonder, ſeeing it is the great Spring of the Divine life and conſolation both here and hereafter.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. The laſt Divine Attribute,<note place="margin">The Sanctitie of God.</note> we are to diſcourſe of, is the <hi>Sanctitie</hi> or <hi>Holineſſe</hi> of God, whereof we find great and illuſtrious Characters in ſacred Philoſophie. (1) We find the Sanctitie of God ſet forth in Scripture in a way of eminence and diſtinction from al created Sanctitie.<note place="margin">Exod. 15.11.</note> So <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Who is like unto thee,

Where he placeth Gods tranſcendent Eminence and Elevation above al Creatures, as that wherein his eſſential Sanctitie chiefly conſiſtes. And indeed the peerleſſe Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Gods ſacred Majeſtie is that wherein his Sanctitie chiefly conſiſtes, as we intend anon more fully to demonſtrate. Thus 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. <hi>There is none holy as the Lord:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.2.</note>

If therefore any one be willing to inquire after and into the cauſe of every thing, both of its exiſtence and corruption, he muſt alſo inquire, in what regard it may be best, either as to being, or as to ſuffering or doing any other thing. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this account there is nothing more needful for man to inquire after, either concerning himſelf or other things,</hi>

When I pondered theſe things in my mind, I much pleaſed my ſelf in this, that I had got a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who would inſtruct me in the cauſes of things, according to mine own mind, namely Anaxagoras.</hi> In theſe great Philoſophemes of <hi>Socrates</hi> we have theſe obſervables. (1) Theſe contemplations about the firſt Cauſe, were ſome of his dying thoughts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as his mind were moſt intent on.

                        </gap>, or principal motive, ground, and reaſon of this Antitheſis is this; <hi>If we make God to concur immediately to the Acts and Operations of ſecond cauſes, he muſt then concur to the ſinful Acts of the wil, and ſo be the cauſe of ſin.</hi> This Antitheſis of <hi>Durandus</hi> was generally exploded by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Schole-men, both Thomiſtes and Scotiſtes, and is ſtil by the more ſober Jeſuites. Only in this laſt Age one <hi>Nicolaus Taurelius,</hi> in his Book, <hi>De rerum aeternitate &amp; triumpho Philoſophiae,</hi> has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the patronage of <hi>Durandus</hi>'s Antitheſis, with this advance, even to the ſubverſion not only of the concurſe, but alſo of the conſervation of God. And ſince there has ſtarted up another, <hi>Lud. A Dola,</hi> a Capucine Friar, who has taken greater pains to defend and promove this Antitheſis of <hi>Durandus;</hi> pretending this as the only expedient for an accommodation between the Thomiſtes and Jeſuites. And for the confirmation of this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis they give this commun inſtance: <hi>On the ſuppoſition that a ſtone ſhould hang in the air, and God withdraw al his concurſe for the actuating the ſtone, yet if the force which ſuſpendes its motion down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward were removed, it would, notwithſtanding the ſubſtraction of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine concurſe, move naturally downward,</hi> or to the ſame purpoſe. Albeit I am no friend to thoſe vexatious diſputes, which the Scholes of Theologie, as wel as Philoſophie, now ring of, yet this Antitheſis being, as I conceive, of dangerous conſequence, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but, with modeſtie, expreſſe my juſt averſation from, yea indignation againſt it; with the reſerve of that reſpect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which is due to that learned and pious Divine among our ſelves, who hath undertaken the defenſe of <hi>Durandus</hi>'s Opinion. I ſhal not now enter on the ſolemn ventilation and debate of this Antitheſis, having reſerved this taske, if the Lord favor my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, for another ſubject and ſtile, which may be of more public uſe to forrain Nations; but only touch briefly on ſuch arguments as may confirme mine own Hypotheſis, with brief ſolutions of the contrary objections.</p>
                     <p>That Gods concurſe is not merely conſervative of the <hi>Principe, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> of ſecond cauſes, without any influence on the <hi>Act,</hi> is evident; (1) becauſe <hi>ſubordination and dependence</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes on the firſt, not only for their Beings and Virtue, with the conſervation thereof, but alſo in their <hi>Acting and Cauſing,</hi>
                        <pb n="393" facs="tcp:42100:217"/>doth formally appertain to the eſſential Reaſon and Conſtitution of a Creature as ſuch. For the Dependence of a Creature on God, not only in Being, but alſo in Operation, is, not extrinſee to its eſſence, but involved in the very intrinſec limitation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>Suarez</hi> ſtrongly argues, <hi>Metaph. Diſp.</hi> 31. §. 14. Hence God, by his Abſolute Power, cannot make a Creature, which ſhould be Independent, and not ſubordinate to him in operation: for this implies a contradiction, namely, <hi>that a Creature ſhould be, and ſhould not be a Creature.</hi> For if it depend not on God in al its Operations, it is not a Creature. (2) If the Created Wil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt of it ſelf and maintain its own Virtue and Force, much leſſe can it Act of it ſelf, or by its own power. The force of this Argument lies in this: If the Create Wil cannot of it ſelf conſerve its own Act in Being, when it is produced, how is it poſſible, that it ſhould produce the ſame of it ſelf? Yea, is not the very conſervation of an Act in Being the ſame with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction thereof? Do not Divines ſay, <hi>that Conſervation is but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Creation?</hi> how then can the Wil produce its own Act of it ſelf, if it cannot of it ſelf conſerve the ſame? Or, why may it not as wel conſerve its <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> as conſerve its Act of it ſelf? If we then, as <hi>Durandus</hi> doth, allow God the conſervation of the <hi>Being, Principe</hi> and <hi>Virtue;</hi> muſt we not then alſo allow him, by a paritie of Reaſon, the conſervation of the <hi>Act?</hi> and if the conſervation of the <hi>Act,</hi> why not alſo the production there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? This Argument is wel managed by <hi>Bradwardine, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 24. and 32. (3) Whatever is independent in Acting, muſt alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſo in Being: for termes of Eſſence always bring with them termes or bounds of Activitie: a limited cauſe neceſſarily is limited in its Operations: and where there are limits and termes, there muſt be Subordination and Dependence. Nothing can operate of it ſelf independently as to all Superior Cauſe, but what has Being in and from it ſelf: for Operation and its limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alwaies follows Eſſence and its limitation, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſures us. (4) What ever is variable and mutable neceſſarily dependes on ſomewhat that is invariable and immutable: but every Act of a Create Wil is variable and mutable; therefore dependent on the immutable firſt Cauſe.

To which we replie, [1] That this ſuppoſition is not to be ſuppoſed: for as the concurſe of God is neceſſarily required to conſerve the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> of the ſecond cauſe, ſo alſo as to its motion: neither is it more repugnant to the nature of a ſtone to conſerve it ſelf, than to move it ſelf, on ſuppoſition that the Divine concurſe be abſtracted. [2] <hi>Suarez</hi> wel reſpondes, <q>That it involves a repugnance and contradiction, to ſuppoſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture potent or able to act independently as to the Creators con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe. And the contradiction ariſeth both on the part of the ſecond cauſe, as alſo of the effect; which being both Beings by participation, eſſentially depend on the firſt cauſe. And God may as wel make a Being Independent in Eſſence, as an Agent Independent in Acting: both being equally repugnant to the perfection of God, and imperfection or limitation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q> (3) <hi>Durandus</hi> objectes: <hi>That it cannot be, that two Agents ſhould immediately concur to the ſame action, unleſſe both be only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and imperfect Agents.</hi> The ſolution of this Objection wil be more completely manifeſt when we come to treat of the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Divine concurſe, §. 4. 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> at preſent let it ſuffice, [1] That where total cauſes differ in kind, it is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment or obſtruction to either, that both act immediately in their kind: for the whole effect is totally produced by each. [2] That it implies no imperfection in God to act immediately in and with the ſecond cauſe; becauſe it is not from any Inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience or Indigence, that he makes uſe of the Creature, but only from the immenſitie of his Divine Bountie, that he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates a virtue to the ſecond cauſe, and together therewith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the effect.</p>

                     <p n="4">(4) But the main objection of <hi>Durandus</hi> and his Sectators is taken from <hi>ſinful Acts, unto which, if God immediately concur,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gods concurſe to the ſubſtrate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſin, what.</note> 
                        <hi>he cannot but be the Author of Sin.</hi> [1] This Objection, albeit it may ſeem to favor the Divine Sanctitie, yet it really deſtroyes the ſame, in that it ſubvertes the Sacred Majeſtie, his Eſſence and Independence as the firſt cauſe, wherein his Eſſental Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth conſiſte, as before. [2] We eaſily grant, that God is the cauſe only of good, not of moral Evil as ſuch, as before, <hi>c.</hi> 6. §. 3. out of <hi>Plato.</hi> For indeed moral Evil as ſuch has no <hi>real Idea</hi> or <hi>Eſſence;</hi> and therefore no real <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe, but only <hi>deficient.</hi> But yet, [3] we ſtil aver, that God doth concur to the whole entitative Act of ſin, without the leaſt concurrence to the moral obliquitie thereof. For the entitative Act of ſin is of it ſelf (abſtracted from the moral deordination) phyſically or naturally good. Whence that commun ſaying in the Scholes, <hi>Al evil is founded in good, as in its ſubject.</hi> There is no pure Evil, but what has ſome natural good for its <hi>ſubſtrate mater</hi> or ſubject: Now al good, that is not God, muſt be from God, as the prime cauſe: if God were not the immediate eſſicient of the entitative Act of evil, he were not the cauſe of al good. Yet, [4] Gods immediate concurſe to the material Act of ſin, doth no way ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him obnoxious to that imputation of being the Author of ſin: For he concurs to the material Act of ſin, not as a <hi>moral</hi> cauſe, but only as a <hi>phyſic</hi> cauſe. God neither commands, nor invites, nor encourageth any to ſin, but prohibits the ſame; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not the Author thereof. An <hi>Author,</hi> both according to Philoſophie and Civil Law, is he that <hi>Perſuades, Invites, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> or by any other <hi>moral</hi> influence promoves a thing: But God by no ſuch waies doth cauſe ſin. [5] Albeit God concurs with the deficient cauſe to the material entitie of ſin, yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs not as a <hi>deficient</hi> cauſe. For the Soverain God is not tied up by the ſame Laws that his Creature is. The ſame ſinful Act, which is a Deordination in regard of man, as it procedes from God is a conformitie to his Eternal Law or Wil. The great God breaks no Law, albeit the Creature is guilty thereof. (6) God, as the firſt cauſe, brings good out of that very Act, which is evil in regard of the ſecond cauſe. The crucifying of our Lord, which was a ſin of the firſt magnitude in regard of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was yet by the wiſe God turned to the greateſt good: Thus the Moral Evils of men, which are oppoſed to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42100:219"/>good, are yet ſo wiſely ordered by God, as that they are made ſubſervient to the good of the Creator. As wicked men oft extract evil out of good, ſo the bleſſed God extractes good out of evil. Touching Gods concurſe to, and gubernation of ſin, ſee more copioſely, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. §. 2.</p>

(1) To ſuppoſe the Wil to Act, without being actuated and influenced by God, is to ſuppoſe it Independent and not ſubordinate to God in ſuch acts. (2) Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wil of man muſt be ſubordinate to and dependent on the wil of God in al its acts; or the wil of God muſt be ſubordinate to and dependent on the wil of man. For in cauſes that concur to the ſame effect there muſt be ſubordination on the one part, if there be no room for coordination; as here is none. (3) If God by his concurſe produce the act of willing, as our Adverſaries the Jeſuites and others grant, how is it poſſible, but that he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and actuate the wil? Doth not every efficient cauſe, in producing an Act in a ſubject connatural to the power or facultie of the ſaid ſubject, influence and actuate the ſame power? (4) Al grant, that the effect of the wil is produced by God: and may we not thence ſtrongly argue, that the volition or act of willing is alſo produced by God, and that by immediate influence on the wil? Is it not equally neceſſary, that the concurſe of God reach, as wel the active as paſſive efficience of the wil? What reaſon can there be aſſigned by the Jeſuites and Arminians our Antagoniſtes, why the wil ſhould not as much depend on the concurſe of God for its act of volition, as for its effect? If the effect of the wil cannot be produced, but by the immediate concurſe of the firſt cauſe, how can the wil it ſelf act, without being actuated by God? (5) Can any act paſſe from the wil, but by the concurſe of the firſt cauſe? and if ſo, muſt not alſo the ſame firſt cauſe influence the wil for the production of ſuch acts?</p>

                     <p n="2">(2) <hi>Al ſecond Cauſes, if compared with the firſt, are but inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his principal concurſe.</hi> Thus not only <hi>Aquinas, Bradwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> and the more ſane Scholaſtics, but alſo <hi>Averroes, de Somno &amp; Vigilia;</hi> where he affirmes, <hi>That ſecond cauſes are moved by the firſt, as inſtruments by the Artificer.</hi> But here occurs a ſpinoſe knotty queſtion much ventilated in the Scholes, <hi>Whether the Wil in the reception of ſupernatural habits be an inſtrument or principal cauſe?</hi> According to the former diſtinctions I ſhould anſwer, [1] That, according to the general notion of an Inſtrument, the Wil may be termed ſuch in the reception and acting of Grace. As it receives Grace it is a paſſive inſtrument, yet as it actes Grace it is an active inſtrument. [2] That the Wil in the receiving and acting Grace is a <hi>vital</hi> inſtrument.

                        <hi>a Divine Inſtrument, a rational Inſtrument, an Inſtrument compoſed and knocked at by that preclare Artificer the Spirit of God.</hi> In receiving the firſt Grace the Wil is only <hi>naturally, remotely</hi> and <hi>paſſively vital,</hi> as it is a piece of human Nature; but in the actuating what Grace is received, it is a <hi>ſpiritually vital</hi> inſtrument. Grace received elevates the human Soul to a <hi>ſpiritual Vitalitie</hi> and <hi>Inſtrumentalitie</hi> for the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grace. Hence, [3] the Wil may, as to the acting of Grace, ſo far as it is clothed with Divine habits, be termed in ſome reſpect a <hi>principal Agent,</hi> under God, ſpecially if compared with the effect produced. It's true, if the Wil be compared with God, even in the acting of Grace received, it is but a mere inſtrument; becauſe both <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> are received from God: yet if we conſider the Wil as inveſted and qualified with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural habits, which are the ſame to the Soul that it is to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, whereby it is informed and capacitated to produce ſuch or ſuch ſupernatural Acts and Effects, in this regard we may ſtile it a <hi>principal cauſe:</hi> though, I muſt confeſſe, the notion of an <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> uſed by <hi>Aquinas</hi> and others, ſeems more adequate and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine to expreſſe its cauſalitie by, in as much as al is from God by ſupernatural infuſion.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. Having inquired into the Concurſe of God in regard of its object,<note place="margin">Divine Concurſe as to its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe the ſame with Gods Wil.</note> we now procede to conſider it as relating to its <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Principe,</hi> which wil afford to us great notices of its genuine nature. The Scholaſtic Theologues, in their debates about the concurſe of God to the ſupernatural Acts of the Wil, are greatly divided: ſome placing it in a certain efficacious impulſe or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, whereby the Wil is determined to conſent and act: others, in a certain actual premotion in the manner of a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient qualitie, together with the operation of the Wil: others, in the very operation of the ſecond cauſe or Wil, as it procedes from the influxe of God premoving. Theſe make it to be an <hi>efficacious premotion</hi> or <hi>phyſic predetermination,</hi> whereby the firſt cauſe makes the ſecond to act: others place this concurſe, as to gratioſe effects, in certain pious inſpirations, cogitations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberate motions of love injected by God. Albeit ſome of theſe ſcholaſtic ſentiments may have their place, if we conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe of God with relation to its <hi>paſſive Attingence,</hi> or as it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates on the ſecond cauſe and effect, yet if we take it ſtrictly, according to its formal Idea, I conceive, no one of theſe opinions
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:42100:222"/>explicate the true nature thereof. Therefore to explicate the genuine nature of the Divine concurſe we muſt conſider what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it has to the Divine Wil, whether it be really diſtinct therefrom, or not. And here we muſt in the firſt place reflect on what was aſſerted and proved in the former <hi>C.</hi> 5. §. 4. touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>ordinate</hi> or <hi>executive power</hi> of God, and its Indentitie with the Divine Wil: which being ſuppoſed, as it has been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, it naturally follows, <hi>that Gods concurſe, as to is active At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence and effective principe, is nothing elſe but the omnipotent effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious volition of God.</hi> For Gods executive power being the ſame with his Effective Wil, it thence neceſſarily follows, that his concurſe is the ſame alſo. Hence Sacred Philoſophie every where makes Gods Wil the <hi>Effective Principe</hi> whereby althings are made, and governed, or directed to their proper Actions and Ends. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. and 115.3. and 135.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2, 3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6. and elſewhere, as before <hi>C.</hi> 5. §. 4.

                     <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>God as the firſt cauſe of althings doth not concur by his Eſſence abſolutely conſidered.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gods concurſe not his eſſence abſolutely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> For, (1) If God ſhould concur by his Eſſence abſolutely conſidered, he ſhould act althings by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſſitie, not with any precedent Libertie: and then Gods making the world, yea things moſt contingent would be as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and naturally neceſſary, as his loving himſelf. It's true, Gods loving himſelf and al other immanent Acts have a conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant Libertie or Divine ſpontaneitie attending them, yet they admit not any Antecedent Libertie or Indifference of any kind. But now Gods workes <hi>ad extra,</hi> ſuch as terminate on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have not only a <hi>Concomitant,</hi> but alſo <hi>Antecedent</hi> Libertie, or ſome kind of <hi>Indifference;</hi> ſo that God could, according to a <hi>ſignum rationis,</hi> or <hi>prioritie of nature,</hi> not have willed them.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:42100:222"/>(2) If God ſhould worke althings by his Eſſence abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, things <hi>poſſible</hi> ſhould have one and the ſame Idea with things <hi>future;</hi> and ſo Gods Science of <hi>ſimple Intelligence</hi> ſhould be the ſame with his <hi>Science of Viſion.</hi> And the reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is moſt evident; becauſe the Eſſence of God abſolutely conſidered is equally indifferent to things poſſible, which ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be, as to things future, which are to be. (3) Again, Gods <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> ſhould be the ſame with his <hi>Ordinate,</hi> and his <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience</hi> the ſame with his <hi>Efficience,</hi> if he wrought al things by his Eſſence abſolutely conſidered. (4) Hence alſo it would follow, that God ſhould alwaies worke and put forth his Omnipotence to the utmoſt extent in al operations. For Cauſes that worke from a Neceſſitie of Nature worke to the utmoſt of their power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>Gods concurſe procedes not from any executive Power in God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">No executive power in God, diſtinct from his Wil.</note> This Propoſition has been already demonſtrated, <hi>C.</hi> 5. §. 4. Yet for more abundant conviction, let us examine the <hi>Origine, Neceſſitie,</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of an executive Power in the Creature; and then we ſhal ſee what little ground there is to aſcribe the ſame to God. The great Aſſertors and Promotors of executive power have been <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his Sectators; who, on falſe Hypotheſes, preſume, <hi>That a ſubſtance cannot act immediately without ſome exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power;</hi> which they make a ſpecies of Qualitie. Albeit ſuch kind of <hi>Qualitative Powers</hi> are now generally exploded by al, who reſolve not to ſerve an Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> yet there ſtil remains a place for executive powers in nature, when the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent cannot reach the effect immediately. Thus the Soul of Man puts forth al Acts of ſenſe and motion by ſome executive powers. Yet the human Soul can and doth oft act immediately, ſpecially in its immanent acts, without any executive power. And thus God in al his Effects actes immediately by his omnipotent wil, without any executive power: For he is preſent in and with al effects, and therefore needs no executive power to ſupplie his abſence. Again, the Wil of God is Omnipotent, as <hi>c.</hi> 5. §. 3. and we ſhal anon prove it more fully, and therefore it needs no exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power to execute what it wils. Is not the Divine Wil propoſed to us in Sacred Philoſophic as Irreſiſtible? and if it be ſo, can it not then execute its own pleaſure, without any exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power? Indeed the greateſt Scholaſtic wits have eſpouſed and defended this Hypotheſis, namely, <hi>That the Wil and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power of God are really the ſame, and not ſo much as rationally
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:42100:223"/>or formally diſtinct.</hi> Thus <hi>Joan. Major,</hi> 2. <hi>Sent.

                        <note place="margin">The Divine Wil Omnipotent.</note> This Propoſition is moſt evident; (1) becauſe the Divine Wil cannot be fruſtrated. Thus <hi>Suarez,</hi> 1.2 <hi>ae.

(3) The Wil of God is infinite: therefore Omnipotent and Irreſiſtible: for where the power of the Patient doth not excede or equaliſe the power of the Agent, there can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent reſiſtence: what then can reſiſt the Divine Wil which is infinite?

(1) When we ſay, Gods concurſe to al ſecond cauſes and effects is immediate, we do not thereby exclude al means, as if God did ſo concur as not to make uſe of ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and inſtruments; but that God concurs immediately in and with al means. As in order to health God preſcribes and uſeth means, yet he concurs immediately in and with thoſe means; ſo in ſupernatural effects, God uſeth Miniſters and Ordinances, yet concurs immediately in and with them. (2) God concurs <hi>immediately</hi> to al ſecond cauſes and effects, not only by the <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Virtue,</hi> but alſo [<hi>immediatione ſuppoſiti</hi>] <hi>by the immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Eſſence:</hi> for indeed the virtue of God is nothing elſe but his Eſſence, or Wil as the effective Principe of althings.

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42100:225"/>from his Virtue, which is his effective omnipotent Wil. Theſe premiſſes being laid down we procede to explicate and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Immediation of Gods Concurſe in the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>God concurs immediately unto every Act of the ſecond Cauſe.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">God concurs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Act of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes.</note> This Propoſition is aſſerted not only by the Thomiſtes, but alſo by the Jeſuites, <hi>Suarez, Metaph. Diſp.</hi> 22. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. and others. And the reaſons are invincible: (1) <hi>From the ſubordination of al ſecond cauſes to the firſt. Ariſtotle,</hi> in his Phyſics, <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 5. &amp; <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſ. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12. aſſures us, <hi>That in Agents</hi> per ſe <hi>and properly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, the inferior cannot act without the influxe or concurſe of the ſuperior cauſe.</hi> And the reaſon is evident: becauſe if the inferior cauſe could act without the influxe of the ſuperior, it were not ſubordinate unto the ſuperior in that act. Neither is it ſufficient to ſay, that the ſecond cauſe is ſubordinate to God, as its Eſſence and Virtue is conſerved by God, according to the ſentiment of <hi>Durandus</hi> and his Sectators: for ſuch a ſubordination of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe to the firſt is only accidental and remote as to its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And who knows not, that an accidental remote cauſe is not properly a cauſe? Al proper ſubordination implies dependence of the inferior cauſe on the ſuperior, not only <hi>quando</hi> but <hi>quatenus agit, both when and as it actes.</hi> (2) <hi>From the limitation and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of al ſecond cauſes.</hi> Every Being by <hi>participation</hi> is limited: and where there are limits of eſſence, there neceſſarily are limits of Activitie and Operation. A Creature can as wel give Being to it ſelf, as actuate it ſelf independently as to the Firſt cauſe: whatever receives its <hi>Being</hi> by participation, receives alſo its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the ſame mode of Participation. Dependence on God in Operation is as eſſental and intrinſec to the nature of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as dependence on God in eſſence and conſervation of that eſſence. Yea, it is no leſſe than an implicite contradiction to ſay, that a Creature actes without dependence on God for that act, as <hi>Suarez</hi> and others prove. And the reaſon is moſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative: for, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tels us, <hi>The mode of operating alwaies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the mode of eſſence:</hi> If the eſſence depend on God for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and conſervation, ſo muſt the operation. Whatever is a Being by participation, muſt alſo be an Agent by participation. Yea, the very Act of the ſecond cauſe is a Being by participation; and therefore it requires the concurſe and influxe of the Firſt cauſe for its production, conſervation, and promotion. (3) <hi>From
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42100:225"/>the nature of the First cauſe and its perfection.</hi> If God concur not immediately to every Act of the ſecond cauſe, he is not the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal cauſe of althings, neither is he omnipotent, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For that very Act is a real Being, or if you wil a mode of Being, and ſo reducible to real Entitie: it cannot be pure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; becauſe pure nothing cannot be the terme or effect of a real production: If then the Act of the ſecond cauſe be a real poſitive Entitie or Mode, and yet God not the Firſt cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then it neceſſarily follows, that God is not the univerſal cauſe of althings: neither is he omnipotent; becauſe he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that real Act: neither is he moſt perfect; becauſe there is ſomething in nature phyſically perfect, which he is not the cauſe of. Dependence on God as the Firſt cauſe, albeit it implies ſomething of imperfection in the Creature as a Creature, yet it importes perfection in God: neither can his abſolute perfection as the Firſt cauſe be preſerved and maintained without it. (4) <hi>From the Providence of God.</hi> If God as the Firſt cauſe concur not immediately to al Acts of ſecond Cauſes, how can he order, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and governe them, ſo as they ſhal al determine in his own glorie? Again, how can he hinder ſuch Acts as impugne his own ends and deſignes? Doth not this Antitheſis of <hi>Durandus</hi> and others, who denie God to concur immediately to al Acts of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, cut off the chiefeſt part of Divine Providence, which conſiſtes in the ordering and directing al human Acts for his own glorie?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>God as the First cauſe immediately concurs, not only to the Act, but alſo the ſecond cauſe it ſelf, and its wil, if it be a free Agent.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concurs to ſecond Cauſe ſelf.</note> This Propoſition may be demonſtrated, (1) by al the fore mentioned Arguments, which prove Gods immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe to the <hi>Act</hi> of the ſecond cauſe: for every efficient cauſe producing in a ſubject an Act connatural to the power of he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, muſt needs influence and actuate that power: wherefore God the Firſt cauſe producing in the wil of man an act conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural thereto, muſt neceſſarily actuate and influence the ſaid wil in ſuch a production. (2) That gods immediate concurſe reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the human Wil, and not only its Act, is evident, becauſe it determines the Wil to act. For grant but this, that the human Wil is not the Firſt cauſe of its own act, but dependent on God for the production thereof, which the Jeſuites grant; it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows, that it is actuated and determined by God in al its
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:42100:226"/>Acts. It's true, the human Wil is a free Agent and ſo a ſelf-determining power; but yet this hinders not but that it is alſo determined by God as the Firſt cauſe: God determines the Wil to determine it <hi>ſelf;</hi> as he moves the Wil to move it ſelf. If God did not determine and move the Wil, it could not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and move it ſelf. (3) Sacred Philoſophie is expreſſe herein, that God workes immediately on the Wil, as wel as on its Acts and Effects. So <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.13. God is ſaid to worke <gap reason="foreign">

                        <note place="margin">The Act of the firſt and ſecond cauſe the ſame.</note> For the explication of this Propoſition we are to note, that the cauſation of the firſt cauſe is not the ſame with that of the ſecond, but only the action whereby the firſt and ſecond cauſe concur to the production of the effect. For albeit the influxe of the firſt cauſe be diſtinct from that of the ſecond, yet the Act whereby the firſt and ſecond cauſe produce the effect is one and the ſame.<note place="margin">Duo individuo opere operan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes neceſſario agant unum &amp; idem, cùm indiviſa ſit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum actio: ſi autem agerent diverſis actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, oporte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret operata eſſe diviſa: ficut è contrà actio in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſa non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſacere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſa opera. <hi>Groſſeteſle, de Libero Arbitrio.</hi>

SS. where he acutely proves, <hi>That the Action of God and the ſecond cauſe, whereby the effect is produced, cannot be deverſe; becauſe the Effect is but one and the ſame;</hi> which procedes totally from God as the firſt cauſe, and totally from the ſecond cauſe, as hereafter, <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. For the more ful explication whereof we muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Active and Paſſive Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience of God: Gods Active Efficience</hi> is nothing elſe but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent efficacious Act of his Wil; which, without al peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, differs infinitely from the efficience of the ſecond cauſe: yet Gods Paſſive efficience, as it relates to the Act of the ſecond cauſe, is not really diſtinct therefrom: for it's no way incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or inconſiſtent, that one and the ſame act procede from two
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42100:226"/>different total cauſes of different kinds, ſuch as the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe is. Whence it follows, that one and the ſame act both of firſt and ſecond cauſe immediately and eſſentially depend on both in their kind. That the firſt and ſecond cauſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concur to the ſame effect, by one and the ſame indiviſible Act may be demonſtrated, (1) from the <hi>Dependence</hi> which the Act of the ſecond cauſe has on the active cauſation of the firſt cauſe. The Act of the ſecond cauſe doth not, as ſome conceive, depend on any real influxe or concurſe tranſient from the firſt cauſe, and diſtinct from the act of the ſecond cauſe, but on the mere efficacious volition of the firſt cauſe; which is the effective principe of al effects. This is acutely demonſtrated by <hi>Suarez, Metaph.

Therefore to the univerſal influxe of the firſt cauſe there is no more required, but that the action of the ſecond cauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from his Wil—not that it procede by another externe action; but it can procede immediately by it ſelf from the wil of God. Whence, when the action of the Creature is ſaid to depend on the influxe of God, either this influxe muſt be taken for the immanent interne Act, as it influenceth the externe Act of the ſecond cauſe; or the manner of ſpeech muſt be taken not tranſitively, ſave according to ſome rational conception.</q> If we would ſpeak properly, it muſt be ſaid, <hi>that the action of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is from God.</hi> Whence he concludes, in the ſame page thus: <q>By comparing the action of the Creature to the interne action of God, it is clear, that the action of God is in order of nature before the action of the ſecond cauſe. Whence it's ſaid, that the concurſe of the firſt cauſe is before that of the ſecond; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſecond cauſe doth not act but in the virtue of the firſt.</q> Hence, (2) we may farther demonſtrate the Identitie of the act, whereby the firſt and ſecond cauſe concur to the effect, by the <hi>Independence</hi> which the act of the ſecond cauſe has as to al tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient acts of the firſt cauſe diſtinct from it ſelf. For if the action of the ſecond cauſe be from God, by ſome tranſient influxe diſtinct from it ſelf; then that influxe being a Creature wil neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome other tranſient influxe for its production and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and ſo into infinite. (3) That the action, whereby the firſt and ſecond cauſe concur to any effect, is one and the ſame
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:42100:227"/>may be demonſtrated from the <hi>Inutilitie and needleſſe ſuppoſition</hi> of any diſtinction between them. For if there be ſuppoſed two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct actions, one of God, another of the ſecond cauſe, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily concurring to the production of one and the ſame effect, then the action of the ſecond is from God, or not: It cannot be ſaid, that it is not from God, but only from the ſecond cauſe; becauſe then it would be ſaid, that the Effect of the ſecond cauſe is from God, but not the Act, which is againſt the nature of a finite limited Being, as we have proved in the precedent Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions: If it be ſaid, that the act of the ſecond cauſe is from God, then there is no neceſſity of ſuppoſing any other act of God diſtinct from this, whereby he concurs to the production of the Effect. Is it not every way ſuperfluous and unneceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two diſtinct actions, one of the firſt and another of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe, as concurring to the ſame effect, when as it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cannot rationally be denied, that the very act of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe is from God? This Argument is wel managed by <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez, Metaph. Diſp.</hi> 21. <hi>S.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 567. The ſum of al is this: Both the firſt and ſecond cauſe concur immediately to the production of the effect by one and the ſame action; yet the influxe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe of the firſt and ſecond cauſe conſidered formally as to the effective principes is really diſtinct.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

The Abſolute Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of Divine concurſe, as to gratioſe effects, is frequently inculcated in Sacred Philoſophie.<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.10.</note> Hence we find a creative effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace aſſcribed to Independent Medicinal Grace.<note place="margin">Eſa. 43.1.</note> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart.</hi> Eſa. 43.1. <hi>The Lord that created thee O Jacob,</hi> &amp;c.

Now what more Independent and Abſolute than a <hi>Creative concurſe?</hi> (1) Workes of Creation are out of <hi>nothing;</hi> and ſo their Efficient muſt needs be Independent as to mater. (2) Workes of Creation require an infinite independent Agent, which admits no ſocial cauſe: for Creation being the production of ſomething out of nothing, which are termes, as to Efficience, infinitely diſtant, none but an Infinite independent cauſe can effect the ſame: who can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <hi>ſomething</hi> and <hi>nothing,</hi> but he who has al Being in himſelf?

Is not the Divine Wil the firſt effective Principe of althings, the ſame with the Divine Eſſence? May we not then as wel make the Eſſence of God to be dependent as his Wil.

God being the firſt Cauſe of althings muſt neceſſarily be independent in his Cauſalitie and Eſſence. For where there is dependence, there is inferioritie and ſubordination: And may we preſume, that the concurſe of the firſt Cauſe is inferior and ſubordinate to that of the ſecond cauſe? Doth it amount to leſſe than a contradiction, to ſay the firſt Cauſe dependes on or is ſubordinate to the ſecond cauſe? What! can it be firſt and yet ſubordinate? What is this but to be firſt, and yet not firſt but ſecond? For dependence and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is an effential mode of the ſecond cauſe, as independence of the firſt. (4) As the concurſe of the firſt Cauſe is <hi>independent,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>abſolute;</hi> yea therefore <hi>abſolute,</hi> becauſe <hi>independent:</hi> for that which dependes on nothing without it ſelf, muſt needs be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute.

When therefore we ſay, that Gods Concurſe is total, we do only denie the <hi>Coordination</hi> or <hi>Copartialitie</hi> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe.

Divine Concurſe, ſpecially as to gratioſe effects, workes al totally and ſolitarily: it admits not of a Corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val or Copartner: it is no partial cauſe, but workes the whole effect, though not without the ſubſervience of inferior cauſes and inſtruments. As in natural cauſes, you aſcribe the whole efficace and cauſalitic of the inſtrument to the principal cauſe; ſpecially if the inſtrument be purely paſſive, without any inherent virtue of its own. As you aſcribe not the victorie to the Generals Sword, but to his Valor: ſo here the inſtruments which Chriſt uſeth in the workes of the new Creation are purely paſſive; they have no efficace, but what is imparted to them by him the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

(3) This alſo is inconſiſtent with the prioritie and antecedence of Gods concurſe: for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial cauſalitie is only ſimultaneous, which has been already refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

Before we come to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it, we muſt premit ſome Diſtinctions and Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. (1) We muſt diſtinguiſh between a general providence, and general concurſe: we denie not but that Gods Providence, as it extendes to althings univerſally, may be termed <hi>general,</hi> which yet doth no way induce or ſuppoſe a general concurſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as is alike commun to al effects and determinable thereby; as the concurſe of the Sun is determinable by the effects it workes on. Such a general concurſe is unworthy of the firſt cauſe, who determines al effects, but is determinable by none. <hi>Bradwardine de Cauſd Dei, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 668. undertakes to give us the origine of this general influxe or concurſe, which he makes to be from the Pagan Philoſophers, 'ſpecially the Aſtrologers, who aſſerted an emanation or irradiation of general influxes from celeſtial Bodies, which they ſuppoſed to be Gods, on al ſubjects or maters. (2) We muſt diſtinguiſh between a <hi>particular cauſe, and a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe.</hi> We do not affirme that God is a <hi>particular cauſe,</hi> but an <hi>univerſal cauſe</hi> concurring in a <hi>particular</hi> manner to al ſecond cauſes and their effects.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Cauſe,</hi> and yet his concurſe, as to the mode of its operation is <hi>particular.</hi> God is ſaid to be an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Cauſe,</hi> in
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:42100:231"/>regard of the extent of his cauſalitie, as it extendes to al objects, effects, and ſecond cauſes univerſally: and yet his concurſe is <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> as it is not, like that of the Sun, determinable by its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but doth in a particular manner, according to the exigence and condition of the ſubject, determine the ſame. Theſe things being premiſſed we procede to demonſtrate, that the concurſe of God is not general but particular, as to its manner of working with al ſecond cauſes. (1) From the <hi>nature of a General con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;</hi> which is of it ſelf indifferent, but modified and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the mater it workes on: So the influxe of the Sun is only general and indifferent; becauſe modified by the mater it workes on, as it is evident by the colors in a Rain-bow, as alſo by the oppoſite effects it has on the waxe and clay. To ſuppoſe Gods concurſe to be thus General and Indifferent is every way unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the firſt cauſe, which determines al ſecond cauſes, but is determined by none. To aſſert, that the concurſe of God is in the power of the ſecond cauſe or mater it workes on, what is this but to ſuppoſe the ſecond cauſe to be firſt and the firſt ſecond? (2) From the <hi>manifold imperfections</hi> that are hereby impoſed on God. For if the concurſe of God be only General and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, it then hangs in ſuſpenſe, and has not efficace enough to reach its effect, unleſſe it be ſo or ſo diſpoſed. Whence alſo it follows, that it is in the power of the ſecond cauſe to reſiſt or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the concurſe of God, ſo that it ſhal not reach its effect. Hence laſtly it follows, that the concurſe of God is not efficacious and omnipotent, which we ſhal anon prove. (3) <hi>That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe</hi> of God as to its manner of working is not <hi>general</hi> but <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> is aſſerted and demonſtrated by ſome of the moſt acute of the Scholaſtic Theologues.

                     <p>But here it is objected, 1. by <hi>Burgerſdicius</hi> and others:<note place="margin">Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concurſe.</note> (1) <hi>If God concur by a particular concurſe to the ſpecification of the action, then he may be ſaid to walke, diſcourſe, eat,</hi> &amp;c. To this Objection we reſpond, [1] by denying, that God concurs to the <hi>ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the action, albeit he concurs by a particular concurſe: for an action is ſpecified from its particular cauſe, not from the firſt univerſal cauſe. So that here is that which they cal a fallacie of many interrogations, whereof one is true the other falſe. Or, we may cal it a begging of the Queſtion, in that they ſuppoſe, <hi>That, if
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42100:232"/>God concur by a particular concurſe, he concurs alſo to the ſpecification of the action,</hi> which is an inconſequent conſequence. [2] Thoſe Animal acts of walking, eating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> aſcribed to the ſecond cauſe, cannot be aſcribed to God the firſt cauſe, albeit they more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally belong to him; becauſe they procede not from <hi>pure effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience,</hi> but from <hi>information,</hi> (to uſe the Ariſtotelean phraſe) or a bodie ſo organiſed. Thoſe actions ſignifie a relation to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſubject whence they ſlow, and therefore cannot be properly attributed to God, as <hi>Bradward. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 178. and <hi>Suarez Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſ. Diſput.</hi> 21. <hi>S.</hi> 3. acutely replie, ſhewing that <hi>ambulation, eating,</hi> &amp;c. do not denote pure efficience, but a ſubject informed by ſuch motions, which are therefore proper to the ſaid ſubject. (2) But the main objection of <hi>Burgerſdicius</hi> and others againſt Gods particular concurſe is taken from <hi>ſinful actions, unto which,</hi> ſay they, <hi>God cannot be ſaid to concur by a particular concurſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we make him the author of ſin.</hi> This objection makes a great noiſe, but has little of weight in it. For (1) The deordination of any ſinful act can only be aſcribed to the ſecond cauſe, who is the Author of it, not unto the firſt cauſe, who only produceth the phyſical entitative Act. [2] That which is moſt ſinful in regard of the ſecond cauſe, is ſo ordered by God, as that it ſhal conduce to the greateſt good, as before, and hereafter in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God.</p>

                     <p>But for the more ful explication and demonſtration of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacitie of Divine Concurſe, we are to conſider, that there is a twofold Concurſe of God, one <hi>moral;</hi> the other <hi>efficacious;</hi> which ſome terme <hi>phyſic Concurſe,</hi> becauſe it workes according to the manner of <hi>phyſic Efficients.</hi> For a <hi>phyſic Cauſe</hi> is that which really and properly influenceth the Effect: but a <hi>moral Cauſe,</hi> as dictin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from <hi>phyſic,</hi> is that which contributes not any real and proper influxe for the production of the effect, yet he doth ſo far morally concur, as that the effect is imputed to him, as it's wel determined by <hi>Suarez, Metaph. Diſput.</hi> 17. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 402. A moral cauſe doth not reach the effect immediately, neither doth it properly move and determine the Agent, but only obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively and remotely, by Commands, Arguments, Incentives, Motives, and ſuch like moral influences: which is only a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoric,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42100:234"/>indirect, remote, improper, and inefficacious kind of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience. But now a <hi>phyſic Cauſe,</hi> is that which alone deſerves, and therefore in the Scholes has appropriated to it ſelf the name of an <hi>efficient Cauſe;</hi> becauſe it doth by a proper, real, direct, and efficacious influxe or cauſalitie reach its effect. God has both a <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>phyſic</hi> or efficacious concurſe in and for the production of moral good. He commandes, propones arguments, invites, perſuades what is good; as alſo efficaciouſly workes the ſame in thoſe he intendes to do good to. But as for ſinful acts God doth not by any moral concurſe concur thereto, and therefore they may not be imputed to him as the Author of them.</p>

(3) From the <hi>Determination of the ſecond cauſe by the firſt.</hi> Gods Concurſe is not only moral, by propounding objects and perſuading thereto; but really <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> and <hi>productive</hi> of things. Now in al cooperation the cauſes cooperating are either coordinate or ſubordinate: the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe cannot be coordinate, but the later muſt be ſubordinate to the former: and if ſubordinate to, then it muſt be determined by the firſt Cauſe. It's certain, that either the ſecond cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the firſt, or the firſt the ſecond: and is it not more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the firſt cauſe ſhould determine the ſecond, than that the ſecond ſhould determine the firſt to act? Can we imagine, that the concurſe of the firſt cauſe is in the power of the ſecond? Is it not more agreable to the Nature of God, and the condition of a Creature, to determine, that the cauſalitie of the ſecond cauſe is ſubordinate unto, and therefore determinable by the concurſe of the firſt cauſe?

Creation</hi> is the <hi>Efficience</hi> of the firſt Cauſe, whereby he made althings at firſt, and ſtil continues to make ſome things out of nothing. What lively No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices we have of Gods Creating althings out of nothing, both in Sacred and Platonic Philoſophie, hath been ſufficiently explicated and demonſtrated in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Phyſics, <hi>Court Gent. P.</hi> 2. <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>S.</hi> 1. &amp;. Our preſent taske wil be to give ſome general Ideas of the Creation as it appertains to Gods prime Efficience. 1. It's moſt evident, <hi>that no finite Being can be eternal or from eternitie.</hi> Al the Philoſophers before <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> generally aſſerted the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of althings by God: but he, from a confined miſtaken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods infinite Effcience, fondly conceited the firſt mater to be eternal; becauſe he could not imagine, how ſomething could be educed out of nothing. But true Philoſophie, as wel as Divine Revelation teacheth us, that althings were made by God, and nothing beſides himſelf is eternal. That the world was not from eternitie we have ſufficiently demonſtrated, in what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes touching the <hi>exiſtence of God, C.</hi> 2. §. 2. This Argument is wel managed by <hi>Derodone, l'Atheiſme Convaincu, C.</hi> 1. And <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez, Metaphyſ. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 536. ſtrongly demonſtrates, That <hi>it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally repugnant to Creation that it be eternal.</hi> Yet the Jeſuites generally grant, <hi>That it is poſſible for the world to be from eternitie.</hi> Which Hypotheſis comes not ſhort of a virtual contradiction: for what difference can be rationally imagined between <hi>being eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and being from eternitie?</hi> Is not that which is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eternal? And can we imagine that to have a beginning, which is from eternitie? Can any effect and product of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wil be commenſurate to it in point of Duration?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To Create is the ſole Prerogative of God.</hi> For (1) the order of actions muſt be according to the order of Agents: the moſt Noble and Supreme Action cannot agree to any but the moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:42100:237"/>and Supreme Agent: And is not Creation the moſt Noble and Supreme of al Actions? Can it then agree to any but the moſt Noble and Supreme Agent, God? Creation is the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of al actions, by which a participate Being may be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated; becauſe it primarily ſpeakes the production of the whole entitie in its ful latitude:. whence it is manifeſt, that this action cannot be appropriated or attributed to any, but the firſt cauſe, who is Being eſſentially and of himſelf: no participate being has force enough to produce the whole of Being. (2) That <hi>Creation</hi> is proper to God may be argued from the <hi>Mode of Efficience.</hi> For Creation ſuppoſeth an Omnipotence and Independence in the Creator; in as much as he has no <hi>paſſive</hi> power or mater to worke on, but only an <hi>objective</hi> power or poſſibilitie of the object to be Created, which requires an infinite active power in the Agent. For by how much the more remote the paſſive power is from Act, by ſo much the greater ought the active power of the Agent to be: whence where there is no preexiſtent mater to worke upon, but a mere obediential objective power or nothing, there the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Power and Act is, as to efficience, infinite, and impertranſible by any finite power: therefore nothing but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power can bring the extremes <hi>Nothing</hi> and <hi>Something</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. (3) <hi>From the Nature of Creation;</hi> which is, not a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive but a momentaneous Action: but al the productions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, as they are inferior to, and Inſtruments of the firſt cauſe, are ſucceſſive motions: for al Inſtruments act and move in a way of ſucceſſion. (4) From the limitation of al <hi>ſecond cauſes.</hi> For the moſt perfect of Creatures have only a precarious and Participate Being; and therefore have not in themſelves vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or force enough to Create the leaſt of Beings. To Create re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a virtue of the moſt Supreme Order, inveſted with an Active Power in the moſt univerſal latitude. And the reaſon is evident; becauſe the Creative Power extendes it ſelf to every thing creable: neither doth it expect on the part of its object any thing, but a non-repugnance or obediential power that the effect may be. This wil more fully appear from the following Theſis.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Creation the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> 
                        <hi>Creation is the production of Something out of Nothing.</hi> When we ſay <hi>Creation is the production of Something out of Nothing;</hi> the particle <hi>out of</hi> muſt not be underſtood as denoting any ſucceſſion of one thing after another, (for Creation is but an inſtantaneous
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:42100:237"/>eduction) but only the negation of a material cauſe. Now that God Created althings without any preexiſtent mater may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, (1) <hi>From his Independence and prime efficience as the firſt cauſe.</hi> For the firſt Independent Cauſe being a pure ſimple act, muſt neceſſarily precede al mater, and thence be the cauſe thereof: that which is the firſt in Beings muſt neceſſarily be the cauſe of al the reſt: whence it follows, that the firſt mater was produced by God out of no preexiſtent mater but out of nothing. (2) <hi>From the univerſal efficience of God, as the firſt cauſe.</hi> Every Agent, ſo far as it is confined to mater, ſo far it is particular and limited: for to be confined to mater in acting, is to act in order to ſome determinate ſpecies, whereunto that mater refers: wherefore that Agent which is univerſal, and commenſurate to al effects poſſible, cannot be confined to mater: ſuch is the firſt cauſe. (3) <hi>From the univerſalitie of Effects produced by Creation.</hi> By how much the more univerſal the effect is, by ſo much the higher the cauſe is: and by how much the higher the cauſe is, by ſo much the more it is extended to al effects. Whence the effects of Creation being of al moſt univerſal, and the cauſe moſt high, there cannot be ſuppoſed any preexiſtent mater out of which they are educed. (4) Al productions out of mater ſuppoſe <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive motion and Tranſmutation:</hi> but Creation is not a ſucceſſive but momentaneous motion all at once. Al ſucceſſive motion and mutation muſt neceſſarily precede, as to Duration, the effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſuch a mutation or motion: but Creation doth not by any kind of Duration precede the things created: therefore it cannot be ſucceſſive, out of preexiſtent mater.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Active Creation is nothing elſe but the Act of the Divine Wil,</hi>

And albeit it may ſeem to carrie a novitie with it, yet it has ſufficient foundation both in Sacred and Scholaſtic Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie. As for Sacred Philoſophie, its very mode of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Gods active efficience in creating althings plainly ſhews that it was no other than the Act of the Divine Wil.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.3.</note> Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3. <hi>and God ſaid, Let there be light.</hi> Which <hi>Word</hi> or ſaying of God can be underſtood of no other than the Act of his Divine Wil.

                        </gap> here, and elſewhere aſcribed to God, thereby to expreſſe the efficacions efficience of his Divine Wil in the production of althings. Thus <hi>Maimonides, More Nevochim,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:42100:238"/>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 65. demonſtrates, <q>That this <hi>Speech</hi> or <hi>Word,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by althings were made, muſt be underſtood of the Divine Wil, not of any proper Speech; becauſe al Speech, whereby any thing is commanded, muſt neceſſarily be directed to ſome Being exiſtent, and capable of receiving ſuch a command: but there was no Being then exiſtent; therefore it muſt be underſtood of the Divine Wil.</q> Thus <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.3. <hi>The world was framed by the Word of God.</hi> So 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. <hi>By the Word of God the Heavens were of old.</hi> An why is the efficience of the Divine Wil in creating althings expreſſed by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but to ſhew, that as we, when we wil have any thing done, expreſſe our Wil by our word of command; ſo God expreſſed what he wil have accompliſht, by his <hi>Fiat</hi> or Creative Word. See more of this effective Word in the Providence of God, §. 3. This Hypotheſis of Gods Creating althings by his Wil hath found Patrons not a few among the moſt accurate Scholaſtic Theologues. Thus <hi>Joan. Major, Sentent.</hi> 2. <hi>diſt.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 3. proves, <hi>That God produced the World by his mere Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Volition, without any other productive power.</hi> And his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are theſe: (1) The Human Wil doth not want any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther executive power to execute its commands, unleſſe it be in ſuch things as it cannot by it ſelf reach: but the Divine Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Wil reacheth althings: therefore it can execute its own commands, without the mediation of any executive power. (2) The Efficacious Wil of God touching <hi>A.</hi> gives exiſtence to <hi>A.</hi> otherwiſe the Efficacious Wil of God were impedible; and ſo ſome one might reſiſt his Wil. (3) Our Wil can by its mere volition produce ſome effects, namely Habits; it can alſo move other Powers by its Empire: Therefore the Divine Wil can by its ſole volition produce al effects. Thus <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. <hi>With God to Wil in to do; becauſe althings receive Being from his Wil.</hi> The like <hi>Damaſcene, Orthod. Fid. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 29. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Althings that the Lord hath willed, he hath done, and no man hath reſiſted his Wil: he willed that althings were made, and they were made: and he wils that the world conſiſtes, and it conſiſtes: and al that he wils he can do, and they are done.</hi> From this Active Creation of the Divine Wil God is ſaid by ſome to be a Creator from al Eternitie. Thus <hi>Gregor. Ariminenſis, Sent. l.</hi> 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 28. <hi>q.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 122. This denomination is not extrinſec
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:42100:238"/>but intrinſec to the Divine Eſſence and Wil. Hence <hi>Plato</hi> ſtiled the <hi>World</hi> in regard of this active Creation, <hi>Eternal,</hi> as it lay, from al Eternitie, in the Divine Wil and Ideas. For the <hi>Active Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of the Divine Wil is every way ſufficient to denominate the <hi>Paſſive Power</hi> of the World as creable.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Paſſive Creation is ſomething in the thing created, not really,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Paſſive Creation a Mode of the thing Created.</note> 
                        <hi>but mentally or modally only diſtinct from it.</hi> For the explication of this Propoſition we are to note, (1) That <hi>Paſſive Creation</hi> doth not ſo much regard God as the thing Created. God in Creating the World was not reduced from <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Act,</hi> as al Creatures are when they act: for Gods Active Efficience was, as has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, from al Eternitie, and no other than his Divine Wil: neither was there, at the paſſive Creation of the World, any new act in God, which was not before in him: but there was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of an act or exiſtence to the things Created, which was not before: whence, by an <hi>extrinſec</hi> denomination, God is ſaid to be <hi>Creator</hi> at the paſſive Creation of things; as, by an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſec denomination, he was Creator from al Eternitie in regard of his Active Efficience or Decree. (2) Albeit we conceive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>Paſſive</hi> Creation under the notion of a mutation, yet it is not properly ſuch; becauſe al proper mutation implies a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one thing after another; which Creation admits not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing momentaneous and al at once, without any <hi>terme from which,</hi> or <hi>fluxe,</hi> which al mutation includes. (3) Some, and thoſe not vulgar Scholaſtics hold, <hi>That paſſive Creation is no way really but only mentally diſtinct from the Creature.</hi> So the Paſſive Creation of a Man is really and eſſentially the ſame with a Man. Thus <hi>Ocham, in Sent.</hi> 2.<hi>q.</hi> 9. and <hi>Greg. Ariminenſis, in Sent.</hi> 2. <hi>diſt.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 4, &amp; 5. with the <hi>Nominals</hi> generally; who preſume that Action is not a middle thing between the Cauſe and Effect. And their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this Caſe are not to be contemned; for they prove it, [1] <hi>From the ſpecial Reaſon of Creation,</hi> which is not an Accident, but the very ſubſtance or Eſſence of the thing Created: for if it were ſome middle thing between God and the Creature, diſtinct from both, it muſt be a Creature, and ſo the terme of ſome other Creation; and this of ſome other: which would open a door for a progreſſe into Infinite. [2] <hi>From the Eſſential Reaſon of a Creature:</hi> for Dependence on the firſt Cauſe is of the Eſſence of the Creature; therefore it is in the Creature, and not really diſtinct from it: Now the prime and eſſential dependence of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:42100:239"/>on the firſt Cauſe is <hi>Creation:</hi> wherefore it can be no more diſtinguiſhed from the Creature, than the Eſſence of a thing is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from it ſelf. That the Dependence of a Creature on its Creator is not diſtinct from its Eſſence, they prove by many and ſtrong Arguments, of which hereafter, <hi>C.</hi> 11. §. 6.

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>That the Relation of the Creator to the Creature doth not-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any mutation in God.</hi> For Creation may be conſidered either <hi>actively</hi> or <hi>paſſively:</hi> if we conſider it <hi>actively;</hi> ſo it is attributed to God by an interne denomination, it being the ſame with the Wil of God: if we conſider it <hi>paſſively;</hi> ſo it is the ſame with, or not really diſtinct from the Creature, and aſcribed or attributed to God only by an extrinſec denomination and relation, which ſpeaketh no mutation in God.

Doth he not hereby diſcover the infirmitie of his Reaſon, in ſuppoſing a moſt Supreme bleſſed Being, who yet ſtandes as an idle ſpectator of al natural and human occurrences? May we not juſtly conclude, that <hi>Epicurus,</hi> by denying the Providence of God, had a ſecret deſigne to undermine the very exiſtence of the Deitie? For he could not but know, that if the perſuaſion of Divine Providence were rooted out of mens minds, the thoughts of a moſt bleſſed immortal Being would little overawe or influence mens hearts.

(2) The Providence of God may be demonſtrated from that admirable <hi>Order, Concent</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> which is moſt illuſtrious in al parts of the Univerſe.

Is not one thing ordered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for ſome other? Doth not the Sun by its warme influences ſhine on the earth, that ſo it may be fruitful? And why is the earth fruitful but to feed the Beſtes? And are not the Beſtes fed to nouriſh and ſerve Man? And why doth the wiſe God take ſuch care of Man, but that he might be more capable to ſerving his God?<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.21, 22.</note> Thus <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>I wil hear the Heavens, and they ſhal hear the Earth: and the Earth ſhal hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oil: and they ſhal hear Jeſreel.</hi> Here, beſides the gratioſe Benediction of God, the harmonious connexion of the firſt and ſecond cauſes is ſet forth by a lively <hi>Proſopopoeia; Jeſreel, i. e.</hi> the People of God, they cal on or expect relief from <hi>Corn, Wine, and Oil:</hi> theſe cal on, or expect nouriſhment from the Earth: the Earth cals on or expects ſupplies from the celeſtial bodies: and theſe cal on and expect ſupplies from God. Now where there is ſuch an exact ſubordination between varietie of things, which underſtand not themſelves, is it not neceſſary, that there be a wiſe Mind, that ſets al theſe things in order? If there be Order in things that have no Underſtanding, muſt not the ordering of them come from an Underſtanding infinitely wiſe? Is there not an admirable Intelligence even in the Natural and Animal world? What a wonderful Inſtinct is there in the little Bee, as in other Animals? And yet theſe ſilly Animals underſtand not themſelves: muſt there then not be an higher underſtanding that orders al? And that which yet addes to the Order of althings and proves the Providence of God, is, that al theſe various parts of the Univerſe ſweetly conſpire to promove the Glorie of their Creator.

And what is the ſupreme Law, whereby al the Divine operations of Providence are regulated, but the eternal Exemplar of Divine Ideas or Decrees? It's true, every particular ſingular Creature has a Law impacted and impreſſed on its Being, which is an irradiation or beam of the eternal Law, and therefore called by ſome, though improperly, the <hi>eternal Law;</hi> by others more properly the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi> For the eternal Law properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes the workes and operations of God; who is both <hi>Worker,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of his working: the perfection of the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Wil gives perfection and meaſure to al his workes: al Gods providences and workes own him, not only for their Worker, but alſo for the Law whereby they are wrought: his Divine Wil and Decrees being the meaſure of al his Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So that by this eternal Law althings are bounded and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited not only in their Eſſences, but alſo in their Operations: and al the Divine reaſons of Providences are to be reſolved into this eternal Law, which is ful of infinite Reaſons, Wiſdome, and Counſel; albeit our ſhallow capacities cannot comprehend, no nor apprehend the ſame alwaies, in al workes of Providence.</p>
                     <p>Hence it follows:<note place="margin">The Wiſdome of Providence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</note> that the Divine Reaſon, Wiſdome, and Counſel, that attendes the Providence of God, is not merely <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative,</hi> but <hi>practic</hi> and <hi>active:</hi> for al Laws properly and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily tend to action.

And that the wiſdome of Divine Providence is indeed moſt active is evident, in that God by his Providence directes althings to their proper end, namely the Divine Bonitie, which is the laſt End and firſt Principe in Morals. Hence it is that al the workes of Divine Providence are ſaid to be diſpoſed in <hi>Meaſure,</hi> and <hi>Number,</hi> and <hi>Weight, i. e.</hi> in the moſt exact order and manner that may be.

Yea, (3) It belongs to the intrinſec Reaſon of Divine Providence, as Divine, not only to intend and order al means towards its laſt end, but alſo infallibly to attain its laſt end: which implies an abſolute, efficacious, omnipotent Wil. For albeit Providence, in its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric notion regardes not ſo much the end as the means, it being the ordering of means to an end, yet it includes an abſolute effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious volition of the end: but now it's ſimply impoſſible, that God ſhould wil any end, and yet that end not be attained. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Divine Providence greatly differs from human, which oft wils an end and provides means in order thereto, and yet fals ſhort of its end. (4) That Providence belongs to the Wil of God is evident from the formal parts thereof, <hi>Conſervation</hi> and <hi>Guberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which are Acts of the Divine Wil. (5) The Mode of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, as expreſſed both in Sacred and Platonic Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, clearly evinceth, that it formally belongs to the Divine Wil. In ſacred Philoſophie the Mode of Divine Providence is

Whence oft times the Spirit of God uſeth the moſt unapt and unlikely means for the production of the moſt Noble Effects. Yea, oft God brings about the Iſſues of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence by contrary means, which carry in them a ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to what God intends. By how much the more potent the virtue of any Agent is, by ſo much the more doth it extend its operation unto things remote. Now is not the virtue of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence moſt efficacious? May it not then extend its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience to means and effects moſt remote? Doth it not belong to the Majeſtie, Splendor, and Dignitie of a Prince to have many Miniſters of State under him, for the execution of his Soverain Wil and Commands? And doth it not in like manner appertain to the Majeſtie of God, the Supreme Lord, to have varietie of inſtruments and means for the execution of his Providence? Al Providence, according to its formal Idea, includes two things <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Execution:</hi> The <hi>Ordination,</hi> being an Act of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Sapience, belongs to the Supreme <hi>Ordinator;</hi> who, by how much the more judicious and prudent he is, by ſo much the more capacious he is to order al means and affaires in ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his end and deſigne: But the <hi>Execution,</hi> requiring only Force and Power, may as wel and oft more aptly be tranſacted by inferior Agents or Miniſters, inveſted with executive force in order thereto. Thus in Divine Providence the <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of al means the moſt wiſe God reſerveth to himſelf, as a Prerogative peculiar to his Imperial Crown; but the execution he frequently commits to ſecond cauſes and inſtruments, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with executive Forces for the production of the effect, and moreover working immediately, both by the immediation of Virtue and Eſſence in and with thoſe means.

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42100:246"/>that the effect be produced by them in commun, as they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the participation of motion and influence from the Supreme Agent: For many cannot produce one effect but as one: Now the ſubſervient Agents of Providence are ſo far one in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions, as they are ſubordinate to and influenced by God the Supreme Agent. (2) The complement of the Virtue and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace of the <hi>Second Agent</hi> is from the Virtue and Influxe of the <hi>Firſt Agent:</hi> and is not God the firſt Agent in al executions of Providence?

Muſt not then al their Executions and Operations be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him as the prime Cauſe? (4) Al Actions that cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte without the Impreſſion and Influence of ſome Agent muſt be attributed to that Agent as the cauſe thereof: Now can any executions of ſecond Cauſes ſubſiſt without the impreſſion of the firſt Cauſe? muſt they not then al be attributed to him? (5) Whatever applies the active Virtue or draws it forth to act, may be ſaid to be the cauſe of that Act: as an <hi>Artificer,</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the virtue of any natural thing to any action, is ſaid to be the cauſe of that action: Now is not al application of any Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in providential executions from God? Is he not then the cauſe of al ſuch executions? (6) Doth not the Virtue of every inferior Agent depend on the Virtue of the Superior Agent as ſuch? And are not al ſecond Cauſes in providential executions inferior Agents as to God the Supreme Agent? (7) Is not every Worker by its operation ordained to its laſt end? And who, in al Providential Operations, ordains things to their laſt end, but God the firſt cauſe of al?

Either althings muſt fal under the Providence of God, or ſomethings muſt happen merely by chance, without any certain cauſe of their Futurition. (5) From the <hi>Justice</hi> of God in rewarding what is good, and puniſhing what is evil: for the executions of Divine Juſtice depend on his Providence. That Gods Providence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendes to al ſingulars, even to things moſt contingent and minute is acutely demonſtrated by <hi>Aquinas, contra Gent. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 71, 72, 73, 75, 76.

[4] As he is the principal Agent in every Act, and al other Agents but Inſtruments. [5] As he actes immediately in al Acts of ſecond Agents.</p>
                     <p>As for the particular Objects unto which Divine Providence extendes it ſelf they may be thus diſtributed.<note place="margin">The particular Objects of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> (1) <hi>Al natural Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> even the moſt <hi>minute</hi> and <hi>imperceptible</hi> fal under the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.

When men contradict Gods Wil of Precept, do they not obey or ſulfil his Wil of Providence? Is any thing ſo great, that it comes not within his power, or ſo ſmal, that it comes not within his care? I am not ignorant how much ſome of late, as wel Divines as Phyſicians, have eſſayed to exemt the period or terme of human life from the immutable determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Providence: but how much this Hypotheſis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictes both Pagan and Sacred Philoſophie, wil be more fully evident by what follows.</p>

It's true, human providence as ſuch may provide
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:42100:249"/>means moſt proper and expedient, and yet, by the interpoſition of other ſecond cauſes, come ſhort of its end; but Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence always reacheth its end. Thus <hi>Homer:</hi>

Whence ariſeth al active and paſſive virtue in ſecond cauſes, but from Divine diſpoſition? Is it poſſible then that the executions of Divine Providence ſhould be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the force or defect of any inferior Agent or Patient? Are not al natural Agents inſtruments of Divine Providence? And can the inſtrument act without the concurrence of the principal Agent? What then can we ſuppoſe ſhould impede Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? (3) Al providence ſuppoſeth an Act of the Wil: and are not al Acts of Divine Volition efficacious? <hi>Bradwardine</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſſertes and demonſtrates, <hi>That God permits nothing but what he wils.</hi> It's true, man oft permits things, that he neither wils nor doth, becauſe he cannot hinder them; but there is no mere permiſſion with God, without ſome Act of his Wil. This is proved from the infinite Actualitie, Efficacitie, and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Divine Wil. Thus <hi>Bradwardine, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 32. <hi>pag.</hi> 282, &amp;c. ſpends a whole Chapter to prove, <hi>That althings fal out and are governed by the Providence of God, not only permitting, but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſpoſing al.</hi> And his arguments are demonſtrative. As [1] Otherwiſe the Univerſe ſhould not be diſpoſed and ordered in the beſt manner. [2] The Scripture gives God active names as to al parts of providence, &amp;c.

Therefore men act freely, becauſe the Providence of God determines them ſo to act: So that nothing more conduceth to the natural libertie of the Wil, than the neceſſary Determination of Divine Providence, becauſe it determines althings to act according to their Natures: it offers not the leaſt force or violence to the Human Wil, but ſweetly, though neceſſarily moves it to the end appointed. Gods manner of ordering and conducting ſecond Cauſes is without the leaſt prejudice to their proper manner of working: he guides them ſweetly according to the principes and inſtincts he has put into them. For (1) Doth not Divine Providence furniſh every ſecond Cauſe with its Power, Virtue, and Efficacitie to worke? (2) Doth not the ſame Providence maintain and conſerve that Power and Vigor imparted?

Yea, are not thoſe very Diſorders and Confuſions, that ariſe from the Luſts of Men, ordered by Divine Providence in the beſt manner for the good of the whole? As in Nature varietie addes Beautie, ſo in the Providence of God varietie of changes renders it more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.

(3) Providence is diſtributed into <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary: Ordinary Providence</hi> is, when God in the production and governing of things obſerves that Order, which was conſtituted at firſt by himſelf. <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Providence is when God in the <hi>Production, Conſervation,</hi> or <hi>Gubernation</hi> of things breakes that natural Order conſtituted by himſelf.<note place="margin">Of Miracles.</note> The Effects of ſuch extraordinary Providences are, by a Metonymie of the Effect, termed <hi>Miracles.</hi> A <hi>Miracle</hi> properly is a <hi>Specimen</hi> of Creation; becauſe the conſtituted order of Nature being broken, the Mater has only an <hi>Obediential</hi> Power for the production of the Effect. Hence nothing but Omnipotence or Infinite Power can <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>phyſically,</hi> in a way of principal efficience, produce a <hi>Miracle.</hi> It's true the Miniſters of God have, when called to it by him, been Inſtruments of doing Miracles; yet their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or efficience was only <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Inſtrumental:</hi> they wrought al in the Name of God, in a way of faith and dependence on him, and for the manifeſtation of his Glory. Wherefore our Lord Chriſt, by working Miracles in his own Name and Autoritie, without any moral dependence on another, gave an evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Demonſtration of his being God. For no Creature can worke a Miracle by its own <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Phyſical</hi> Efficience:
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:42100:251"/>No; this is the Prerogative of the firſt Cauſe and Omnipotent Deitie; becauſe every Miracle is educed out of nothing, either as to the thing it ſelf, or at leaſt as to the mode and manner of its being wrought. In Nature, and according to the ordinary courſe of Providence every <hi>paſſive power</hi> has an <hi>active power</hi> ſuited to it: and by the application of <hi>Actives</hi> to <hi>Paſſives</hi> the effect is produced: where therefore there is a defect of paſſive or active power, and yet the effect is produced, that we cal a <hi>Miracle:</hi> which may be ſaid to be wrought out <hi>of nothing</hi> three manner of ways. (1) When there is no <hi>ſubſtrate mater</hi> at al to worke on.

In al theſe regards a Miracle may be ſaid to be produced out of nothing, and ſo the peculiar effect of Divine extraordinary providence.

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:42100:252"/>Prop. <hi>God is the neceſſary Conſervator of althings.</hi> No Creature is ſufficient to conſerve it ſelf, or any thing elſe: no particular Agent as ſuch can be properly ſtiled a <hi>conſervant Cauſe;</hi> becauſe conſervation is but a kind of <hi>continued Creation.</hi> That no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſufficient to conſerve it ſelf, without the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative influxe of God, is evident, (1) becauſe every Creature has but a fluid tranſient nature: wherefore it needs the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative concurſe of the firſt cauſe to fixe its fluxible Being. It was a great and good Effate of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Althings are in fluxe, nothing is permanent: i. e.</hi> the natures of things create are like a river, the parts whereof are always in fluxe; neither doth the ſame part ever returne again, but emties it ſelf into the Sea, where it is ſwallowed up: ſo al Creatures are in continual fluxe; and if God, who alone is pure Act and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, did not fixe their Beings by his conſervative influxe, they would ſoon drop into their primitive nothing. (2) It implies a contradiction, that a Creature ſhould perſevere in its being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods <hi>conſervative concurſe.</hi> Doth it not implie a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to ſay, that God made a thing, and yet that thing was not made and cauſed by God? Now to ſay God hath made a Creature, which needs not his conſervative influxe, what is this but to ſay, that God made a Creature, which yet was not made by him? So eſſential is Divine Conſervation to the very eſſence and exiſtence of a Creature, as <hi>Bradwardine, pag.</hi> 162. Thus alſo <hi>Aquinas,</hi> 1. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 104. demonſtrates, <hi>That it is not a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to any Creature, that it ſhould conſerve it ſelf in Being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God.</hi> (3) Whatever is <hi>Ens by participation</hi> neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes on that which is <hi>Ens</hi> by eſſence for its exiſtence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. Al create Beings in their very eſſence depend on <hi>Divine Conſervation;</hi> becauſe every effect that dependes on any cauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and of it ſelf primarily for eſſence, muſt neceſſarily alſo depend thereon for conſervation: But now God is ſo the cauſe of al effects, that they from their very nature and by an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal neceſſitie depend on him for Being; therefore alſo for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, as <hi>Suarez, Metaph.

(4) If God educed althings out of nothing by his efficacious Wil, then it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows, that the Wil of God muſt be the <hi>Conſervatrix</hi> of
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:42100:252"/>althings: For althings are ſo far, and ſo long exiſtent, as God wils they ſhal be. Indeed what is conſervation but continued creation, or the continuation of a thing made in Being? Is it not neceſſary then, that the ſame Divine Wil, that at firſt gave Being to any thing, conſerve the ſame thing in Being? Thence <hi>Aquinas,</hi> 1. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 104. proves, <hi>That God conſerves every thing by the ſame virtue and operation, by which he produced it, i. e.</hi> by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience of his Wil. (5) There is great proportion and Analogie in point of conſervation between the <hi>workes of Art</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> For look as every worke of <hi>Art</hi> doth preſuppoſe a principe and worke of <hi>Nature,</hi> as wel for its conſervation as firſt production; ſo every worke of Nature doth preſuppoſe a Divine Efficience for its conſervation as wel as for its firſt production. Is it impoſſible that a piece of Art ſhould conſerve it ſelf without mater? and is it poſſible, that any worke of Nature ſhould conſerve it ſelf without Divine Efficience? (6) No impreſſion can remain on any effect, longer than the <hi>vis impreſſa,</hi> or force and action of the Agent continue: and what is the eſſence of any Creature but <hi>vis impreſſa,</hi> or force impreſſed by God thereon? Al create Eſſences are but impreſſions or participations from God, and therefore eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially require new force and efficience every moment for their conſervation and continuation. (7) Unleſſe God conſerve althings, how can he order, diſpoſe, and governe them to their reſpective ends? Not only the operations, but the very eſſences of things are ordered by God to his own Glorie: and how can this be, if the eſſences of things are not conſerved by God?

(2) <hi>From the paſſive power or potentialitie of al Creatures.</hi> For every potential or thing in power muſt be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by ſome Act immediately: now every Creature in reſpect of God is but a potential Being; and therefore muſt be actuated immediately by God, who is a pure Act, and that not only in its operation, but alſo for the conſervation of its Being. (3) <hi>From
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:42100:253"/>the Omnipreſence of the Divine Eſſence.</hi> God being not circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed or defined to any ſpace, but immenſe in his Being, it thence follows, that he is intimately and immediately preſent to al Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and by this his immediate preſence and volition conſerves the ſame. As the creatrix Eſſence was immediately preſent by the Divine Volition in the firſt Creation of althings; ſo the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatrix Eſſence</hi> is alſo immediately preſent in the conſervation of althings. God is not more diſtant and remote in the <hi>conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> than he was in the firſt <hi>cauſation</hi> of things: God is more intimate to every thing, than the moſt intimate part of its own Eſſence is. Thus <hi>Suarez, Metaphyſ.

Again, the cauſalitie of the firſt Cauſe is more eſſential and neceſſary than that of the ſecond cauſe: there is no effect, which the ſecond cauſe produceth, but the firſt cauſe can produce it by itſelf. So alſo as to <hi>conſervation.</hi> The firſt cauſe workes by its own proper virtue, and therefore more intimely and immediately than any ſecond cauſe: The virtue of an inferior cauſe is not conjunct with the effect, but in and by the virtue of the ſuperior. (5) <hi>From the efficacitie and vehemence of Gods conſervative Influxe.</hi> By how much the more vehemently and efficaciouſly any cauſe worketh, by ſo much the more penetrant, intime, and immediate is its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxe.

                     <p n="6">6. Prop. <hi>The Conſervation of a Creature and its firſt Creation or Production, as they refer both to God, differ only mentally.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conſervation continued Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Creation gives <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence</hi> unto things, Conſervation, <hi>Continuation</hi> in Being.

Now that the conſervation of ſuch things alſo, as to Gods immediate conſervative influxe, differs not really, but only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally from thier firſt production is manifeſt; becauſe conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to God, whether it be by means or without means, is but one act continued from the firſt inſtant of its Creation or Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: not that there is any real intrinſec ſucceſſion in Gods <hi>Active Conſervation,</hi> which is no other than his moſt ſimple voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but we conceive Gods <hi>Paſſive Conſervation</hi> as ſucceſſive in regard of the Creatures Duration.

HAving diſcuſſed the Conſervation of God,<note place="margin">Divine Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> we now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to his <hi>Gubernation,</hi> whereof we find illuſtrious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices both in Sacred and Platonic Philoſophie. As for Sacred Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophemes touching Divine Gubernation they are very many and great, as it may appear in the particulars thereof. I ſhal at preſent give only the mention of Platonic Contemplations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Thus <hi>Plato, Phileb. p.</hi> 28. <hi>What, O</hi> Protarchus, <hi>may we determine, that althings, and this which is called the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, are governed by a certain temerarious power void of Reaſon, as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune wil? Or rather on the contrary, ſhould we not affirme with our Anceſtors,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>that the eternal Mind, and a certain admirable Wiſdome, ordering al in the moſt accurate manner, doth governe?</hi> He ſaith, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Opinion of the Ancient Wiſe Men, the Providence of God governes and moderates althings in the wiſeſt manner, and with the beſt order. Thus alſo <hi>Iamblichus</hi> ſaith, <q>That the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians, when they introduce God under the Symbolic Image of one that governes a Ship, thereby ſignifie his Domination and Empire as Gubernator of the Univerſe. For as a Gubernator of a Ship in one moment doth eaſily move, governe, and direct the Ship; ſo doth God the world.</q> We find the ſame ſimilitude uſed by <hi>Plato, Leg.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 902, as before. Hence, <hi>this Gubernation of God is that act of Divine Providence, whereby he directes, governes, and brings al his Creatures to their proper ends, in the moſt orderly
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:42100:256"/>manner.</hi> This general Idea of Divine Gubernation may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into the following Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>God is the Supreme Moderator,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">God the Supreme Gubernator. <hi>Eccleſ. 8.4.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Soverain Gubernator, and abſolute Rector of althings.</hi> Thus we may applie <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power;</hi> [or <hi>Domination</hi>] <hi>and who can ſay to him what doeſt thou? i. e.</hi> by how much the more Soverain any perſon is, by ſo much the greater is his Dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God being King of Kings, and Lord of Lords muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be moſt Abſolute in Power and Domination. This is oft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated by <hi>Plato,</hi> and carries with it its own Evidence. For (1) althings receiving their <hi>Being, Perfection, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Operation,</hi> from God, it cannot be, but that he ſhould have an Abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Soverain Empire over them. (2) Althings tend to God as their laſt end: therefore he is the Supreme Rector of al. For when many things tend to one laſt end, it's neceſſary that there be ſome Supreme Rector and Moderator that ordaines them thereto. For Gubernation is nothing elſe but the directing the things governed to their laſt end. Thus <hi>Aquinas,</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 103. <hi>a.</hi> 3. <q>Seing the end of the Gubernation of the world is the beſt good, it's neceſſary, that the Gubernation of the world be beſt: But now the beſt Gubernation is that which is by one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> (3) God is infinitely wiſe to order althings, and potent to bring them to their ends; therefore he is the Supreme Moderator of al. So <hi>Plato, Leg.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 902. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>But that God who is moſt wiſe, both can and wil take care of his own Creatures,</hi> &amp;c. (4) The Bonitie of God argues him to be the Abſolute Rector of althings. For it belongs to Divine Bonitie to reduce althings made by him to thoſe proper ends for which they were made. Whatever flows from God as the firſt Cauſe, muſt returne to him as the laſt end. (5) This is the great concerne of Divine Gubernation, to ſee that althings reach the end for which they were made. For things wil never certainly and infallibly reach the end for which they were made, unleſſe they be directed and governed by the ſame power which made them. It argues imperfection in an Artificer not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the worke he made, to the end for which it was made. And may we impute ſuch an imperfection to the firſt Framer of althings? Hence,</p>

(3) <hi>Plato</hi> illuſtrates this by the Symbol of a wiſe Phyſician and skilful Artificer, who workes al for <hi>the ſake of the whole:</hi> and is not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bonitie and Glorie that great <hi>

That althings are ordered and diſpoſed by Divine Gubernation, for the Glorie of God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, (1) <hi>From the prime motion and cauſalitie of God.</hi> For God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>prime Motor</hi> of althings, and moved by nothing, it thence neceſſarily follows, that by his Providence he governe and move althings to himſelf, as the laſt end. The order of ends neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwers the order of Agents: the firſt Cauſe and Motor muſt needs be the laſt end of althings. (2) <hi>From Gods Dominion over althings.</hi> Every Agent has power to uſe his own workes for the end he made them: and are not al Creatures the workes of Gods hands? Has he not then power to uſe them for his own Glorie? (3) <hi>From the perfection which althings acquire by ſubſerving the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God.</hi> By how much the nearer any Creature approcheth to the Divine Bonitie, by ſo much the more perfect it is: and is not every thing by ſo much the nearer the Divine Bonitie, by how much the more ſubſervient it is to the Glorie of God? It was a good Saying of the ſpurious <hi>Dionyſius: The ſupreme Bonitie convertes althings unto itſelf,</hi> which al deſire as their laſt end, and by which they al ſubſiſt as their moſt perfect end.

                     <p>That wicked men,<note place="margin">Wicked men fal under Gods Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernation.</note> and al their ſinful Acts and Deeds are, by Divine Gubernation, reduced to the laſt end of al, the Glorie of God, wil appear evident, if we reflect on what was before hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if the Creature withdraw it ſelf from one order of Divine Gubernation, it immediately fals under another: if lawleſſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular men ſubſtract and withdraw themſelves from Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and eaſie yoke of obedience in order to life, they deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fal under Gods Iron Yoke of vindictive Juſtice, and Eternal Death: and ſo whiles they violate one Wil and Order of Divine Gubernation, they fulfil another: If they wil not willingly do Gods Wil of Precept, which brings happineſſe with it, what more juſt, than that they ſuffer Gods Wil of puniſhment, againſt their Wils? Thus wicked men fulfil Gods providential Wil, whiles they break his preceptive Wil.

Hence, (3) to explicate in what kind Sin may be ſaid to have a Cauſe, we muſt know, [1] that Sin <hi>formally</hi> as Sin requires not a <hi>final Cauſe,</hi> yet it may admit the ſame in regard of the extrinſec intention of the Agent. That sin formally as ſin requires not a <hi>final Cauſe,</hi> is evident; becauſe conſiſting in a privation and defect, it is not properly and of it ſelf intended in things.

[2] As to the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cauſe,</hi> al Sin has ſome Efficient Cauſe, yet not <hi>per ſe, of it ſelf</hi> and properly, but by Accident, and beſide the primary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſec intention of the Agent.

(5) From the <hi>ſubſtrate Mater</hi> of al evil, which is <hi>phyſically</hi> and <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> good. There is no moral evil, which is not founded and ſubjectated in ſome natural good: even hatred of God, albeit the higheſt moral evil, yet as to its entitative material act it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally good: which is evident by this, that if that act of hatred were put forth againſt ſin, it would be morally good. (6) From the <hi>Ordinabilitie</hi> of al evil to ſome good. There is no act ſo evil, but the wiſe God can turne it to ſome good: the Crucifixion of our Lord, which was one of the higheſt evils, what good was by Divine Gubernation brought out of it? Doth it not much exalt the skil of a wiſe Phyſician ſo to order poiſon, as to make it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disinal? So it exalts Divine Gubernation to bring good out of evil: as it aggravates the impietie of wicked men, that they bring evil out of good. (7) Doth it not take from God the main of his Providence, to denie his Concurſe to the ſubſtrate mater of ſin? What more conduceth to the Amplitude of Divine Providence, than to allow him a Concurſe to and Gubernation of al real Acts and Events? (8) To denie Gods Concurſe to the

Whatever Good or Evil there is under the Sun, as to its real Entitie, muſt have its futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition from the Divine Wil.<note place="margin">Immo &amp; pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum, quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus à Deo juſtè permittitur, cadit in legem aeternam. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtinus, de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitat.

Sin in its own nature, as Antecedent to the Divine Wil, was only poſſible: now how could it paſſe from a condition of mere poſſibilitie to a ſtate of futurition, but by ſome intervening cauſe? And what can we imagine to be the cauſe hereof, but the Divine Wil? May we not then hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Sin was future; becauſe the Divine Wil determined, for juſt ends, to permit its futurition? (2) The Divine Wil is not only the cauſe of ſins futurition; but it has moreover a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Gubernation and Efficience about the actual exiſtence of ſin. [1] As for the <hi>Natural Entitie</hi> of Sin the Divine Wil is the <hi>total immediate</hi> efficient thereof, as <hi>Ariminenſis, Sent.</hi> 2. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 34. <hi>Ar.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 110. [2] The Divine Wil alſo phyſically per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the moral pravitie and obliquitie of Sin, as that which may conduce to the advance of Divine Glorie.

Hence,</p>
                     <p n="5">5.<note place="margin">Gods wil about the Obliquitie of Sin permiſſive.</note> Prop. <hi>Gods Wil about the formal reaſon or obliquitie of Sin is not effective, or defective, but only permiſſive.</hi> (1) That Gods wil about the obliquitie of Sin is not <hi>effective</hi> is evident, becauſe Sin as to its obliquitie has no <hi>effective cauſe.</hi> (2) That the Wil of God is not a <hi>defective</hi> cauſe of Sin, is as evident; becauſe the ſame act which is <hi>defectuoſe</hi> and ſinful in regard of the ſecond cauſe, is not ſuch in regard of God: Man breakes a Law, and therefore ſins, but God breakes no Law: al his Actions are conforme to the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:42100:264"/>Eternal Law. Whence, (3) Gods Wil about the obliquitie of Sin is only <hi>permiſſive.</hi> But now to clear up Gods <hi>permiſſive Wil</hi> about Sin, we are to conſider [1] That <hi>permiſſion</hi> properly as to men is not an action of the Law, but a negation of action: when any permits another to do, what he might hinder, but is under no obligation to hinder. Hence no man may permit Sin; becauſe he is under an obligation to hinder it: but God may; becauſe he is under to obligation to hinder it; as alſo becauſe he can bring good out of it. [2] That <hi>Permiſſion</hi> is either of a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator,</hi> or <hi>Rector.</hi> Gods permiſſion of Sin is not as he is <hi>Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> but only as <hi>Rector</hi> and Governer of the World. God gives no man a legal permiſſion of ſinning, but as <hi>Rector</hi> he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially permit Sin. [3] That Gods permiſſion of Sin as to the event is nothing elſe, but the privation of that aſſiſtance, which being granted would efficaciouſly impede and hinder the exiſtence of ſin. [4] That Gods permiſſion of Sin can be no way ſinful; becauſe he has an abſolute Dominion over his own Influences, and may exert them as he pleaſeth, without injurie to his Creature: whereas al Mankind are bound together by ſuch a mutual ſraternitie and cognation; as alſo by that obedience they owe their Creator, as that they cannot permit Sin without being partakes thereof. Al men are under a communion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore bound by the Law of Nature to afford re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and aid each to other ſo far as they may for the avoiding of ſin. Again, al men are under an eſſential obligation of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their Creator, and ſo far as they may to prevent ſin in others: therefore they cannot permit ſin, without being guilty thereof. But the Supreme Rector, being under no Law or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſubjection, may, for the illuſtration of his own Glorie, permit Sin.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">Gods permiſſive Wil about Sin Efficacious.</note> Prop. <hi>Gods permiſſive Wil about Sin, is not merely Negative, but Efficacious, Bradwardine, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 33. <hi>p.</hi> 289. demonſtrates, <hi>That unto whatever Gods permiſſion extendes, unto that his actual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition extendes alſo.</hi> And his Reaſons are invict; becauſe God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits nothing, but what he wils to permit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So again, <hi>C.</hi> 34. he thus argues: (1) either God wils or nils the permiſſion of Sin: he doth not nil it; for then it cannot be: therefore he wils it. (2) God voluntarily provides for al voluntary workes with al their circumſtances: therefore he voluntarily orders and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſin. (3) <hi>That Sin is,</hi> is a true Propoſition: and whence
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:42100:264"/>comes the truth of this Propoſition, but from the firſt truth? Thence doth not God wil, that this Propoſition, <hi>Sin is,</hi> be true? Whence God wils the permiſſion of Sin. He gives us many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arguments to demonſtrate, that God has an actual Efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wil about the permiſſion of Sin, <hi>p.</hi> 295, &amp;c. In the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin God doth not only nil to hinder it, but he alſo wils not to hinder it. Divine permiſſion in this regard differs much from human: Men therefore permit things to be; becauſe they neither wil that they be, nor yet wil that they be not: whence many things fal out beſides what they intend or wil. But it is not ſo with Divine Permiſſion: nothing fals out, but what God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendes ſhal be; and therefore there can be no Negative Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion aſcribed to his Providence about ſin. To aſcribe unto God a mere Negative Permiſſion about Sin, what is this, but to make God a mere idle ſpectator of Human Affaires? And is not this unbecoming the Supreme Rector of the Univerſe, to ſtand and look on, but not to concerne himſelf about the Gubernation of ſinful Acts? Surely if the permiſſion of God be merely a negation of Wil, it wil neceſſarily follow, that thoſe things that fal out by the permiſſion of God, be either <hi>against,</hi> or <hi>beſide</hi> his wil: if <hi>against his Wil,</hi> then he nils them: if <hi>beſide his Wil,</hi> then he wils them not: But now Sin fals out neither <hi>against</hi> the Wil, nor <hi>beſide</hi> the Wil of God, but according to it. Yea indeed to ſpeak properly and ſtrictly there is no ſuch thing as a Negative Wil of God: the Wil of God taken properly for his immanent volition is always efficacious.</p>

Albeit Sin be in regard of the ſecond Cauſe a defect, yet Gods Gubernation of thoſe defects, ſo as that they may ſubſerve his own Glorie, argues no defect in him: al defects as ſuch belong to the particular cauſe as defectuoſe, not to the firſt Univerſal Cauſe, who orders al thoſe defects to the beſt end: And that the Ordination of thoſe defects belongs to the Gubernation of God is moſt evident, (1) becauſe this greatly conduceth to the Order and Beautie of the whole Univerſe. There

(3) The beſt and moſt perfect mode of Gubernation is, ſo to provide for the things governed, as that they be permitted to act according to their natures: for herein conſiſtes the due order of Regiment.

Whence our Lord makes their obedience the Idea and Exemplar of what we are to pray for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.10. &amp; 18.10.

What their ſin was cannot be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remtorily determined; yet it s generally conceived to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual pride in the reflexion on their own ſublimitie, dignitie, and excellence, which raviſhed their underſtandings into ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant degree of ſelf-admiration, that they loſt the ſenſe of their ſubordination to, and dependence on their Maker: whence their Contemplation, Admiration, Adoration and Imitation of God immediately vaniſht: and of glorioſe pure Spirits they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came moſt <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> as <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.2. &amp; 9.42.</p>

But I conceive, that the higheſt Communion between Angels and Men is ſpiritual, without the aſſumtion of human ſhapes, ſpecially in theſe laſt times: Yet we muſt not denie, but that the Patriarches and Saints under the Law had frequent Apparitions of Angels in viſible formes of men, who converſed with them, eating and drinking, and diſcourſing fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with them, touching the affaires they were ſent about, as

Satan is oft the <hi>Father,</hi> but Sin the <hi>Mother</hi> of Tentation. (2) Satan cannot reach the human Soul or any Act thereof immediately. The heart of Man is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Chamber, into which none can enter but the King of Kings: The thoughts and inclinations of the Soul have a covering over them, which none can take off, but he that made the Soul. Satan may caſt in Fire bals, or ſend in Meſſengers, and Letters, by the mediation of the Phantaſie, but he cannot enter into the heart directly, nor compel it to ſin.

The Spirits of wicked men being very much like unto Satan, by reaſon of Sin and impuritie, as alſo they being his Children devoted to his obedience, thence he comes to have a far greater acceſſe to and power over them, than he had at firſt by Creation. Satan being the Prince of darkeneſſe ſtirs up that darkeneſſe that is in the heart of man to oppoſe Divine Light, as he ſtirs up Luſt to oppoſe the Wil of God. It is difficult but not neceſſary to know all the Myſteries of Satans Power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he enſnares poor Souls, as Birds, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.

And for the demonſtration and explication hereof we

(3) Dependence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes <hi>ſubordination</hi> to that on which the dependence is.

Thus alſo ſhould a Creature affect or arrogate an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, either in Eſſence or Operation, it may juſtly fal under the imputation of <hi>Robberie</hi> againſt God; becauſe it thereby equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſeth itſelf to God.

                        <hi>An independent Being is that which needs not any other Being eſſentially precedent to itſelf, as the cauſe of its Being and Operation.</hi> This Propoſition may be demonſtrated and explicated by its parts thus. (1) <hi>There is one prime independent Being.</hi> This is evident from the ſeries of cauſes, in which we find, that althings obey the ſuperior Power, from which they derived their origine: whence it neceſſarily follows, that to prevent a progreſſe into infinite, we

Hence it follows, (2) <hi>That the first inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Being admits not any precedent Being, as the cauſe of its Being.</hi> For whatever preſuppoſeth the efficience of ſome precedent cauſe, ſuppoſeth alſo <hi>Participation, Poſterioritie,</hi> and <hi>Inferioritie:</hi> which the prime independent Being excludeth. Whence alſo it follows, (3) <hi>That the prime independent Being is</hi>

[2] Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>natural power,</hi> which a dependent Being has, there is an <hi>obediential power</hi> appendent to its nature. For the explication of which we are to know, that it is eſſential to a create Being to be ſubject and ſubordinate to the firſt, increate and independent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far, as to obey it in receiving al impreſſions, and acting under it whatſoever implies not a contradiction. Hence the Scholes diſtribute the power of the ſecond cauſe, or dependent Beings into <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>obediential:</hi> their natural power of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving influences from the ſuperior cauſe, or acting is that which is appendent to their natures, and whereby they naturally receive or act, and produce effects proportionate to their natures. But the <hi>obediential power</hi> of dependent Being is, that whereby they are, according to the Law of their natures, apt to obey the firſt independent Cauſe, namely God in the receiving or acting any poſſible effect, that implies not a contradiction; albeit it may excede the natural capacitie, force, or efficace of their Beings. So that this obediential power regardes ſupernatural effects, which the ſecond cauſe cannot reach by its own Virtue and Activitie; but only as elevated by the efficacious Concurſe of God. Thus the Humanitie of Chriſt had an obediential power to the Hypoſtatic Union, unto which it was elevated by the ſupernatural efficacitie of the Spirit of God. This obediential power which is eſſential to every dependent Being, is founded in the participation and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of a Creature, and its ſubordination to the abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of God, of which more anon.

(1) Dependence both in Eſſence and Operation is ſo eſſential to a Creature, as that the negation of it ſuppoſeth the Creature not to be a Creature. The force and evidence of this Argument wil more fully appear in the explication of the next Propoſition, wherein we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the intime connexion between <hi>Dependence</hi> and the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of a Creature. At preſent it may ſuffice, that we aſſert, that Dependence is ſo <hi>intrinſecally, eſſentially,</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> included in the very notion and eſſence of a Creature, that the negation of it implies a <hi>contradiction in the Adject,</hi> or <hi>an Oppoſite in an Appoſite.</hi> For what doth the notion of a Creature importe, but its educti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of nothing, by the Infinite Power of its Creator? And he that educed althings out of nothing, is it not in his power alſo to reduce althings back to their primitive nothing? And doth not this ſpeak an obediential power in althings as to their Creators Soverain pleaſure? And where there is an obediential power, is there not alſo ſubordination and ſubjection? And doth not al this formally ſpeak Dependence? Thus <hi>Aquinas, contra Gent. L.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 25. demonſtrates, <q>That God cannot make a thing, which ſhal want any eſſential principe: for upon the remotion of any eſſential principe follows the remotion of the thing it ſelf: So that if God ſhould make a thing without any one eſſential prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe, he ſhould make a thing to be, and not to be.</q> And in what follows he proves, <hi>that dependence is an eſſential principe, or mode of a Creature,</hi> as <hi>Suarez,</hi> and that not only as to Eſſence and its Conſervation, but alſo as to operation, of which, §. 10. (2) The Creatures <hi>abſolute ſubjection and ſubordination</hi> to God demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates its dependence on God. That God has an abſolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Creature has been demonſtrated in the precedent Propoſition: and if the Dominion of God be Abſolute, then the Creatures ſubjection to and dependence on God muſt alſo be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and neceſſary. It belongs to the Being of a Creature as ſuch to be ſubject to and dependent on God for the receiving and acting whatever implies not a contradiction. As it is impoſſible, that God ſhould make a Creature, whereof he has not a ful and abſolute Dominion; ſo it is as impoſſible, that a Creature ſhould

(3) The <hi>Indigences</hi> and <hi>Exigences</hi> of the Creature demonſtrate its dependence on God.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, doth not every <hi>potential Being</hi> need ſome <hi>pure Act,</hi> to actuate the ſame? And is not every Creature a <hi>potential Being,</hi> which needs God, the moſt ſimple <hi>pure Act,</hi> to actuate the ſame? Doth not every <hi>Recipient</hi> as Recipient need the active influxe of that principe from wom it receives al? And is not every Creature a mere paſſive recipient as to God, who is the firſt influential Cauſe of its exiſtence, motion, and al? Yea, is not every Creature a mere paſſive <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in regard of the Divine Influxe? Can it ſubſiſt or act without Divine concurſe? Cut off the dependence of a Creature from its Creator, and what an endleſſe Agitation, yea Annihilation would it fal into? See <hi>Aquinas, contra Gent.

Doth not the Stream naturally depend on its Fountain for derivations? and is it not a violence to it, to be cut off from this dependence?

Wherefore albeit we may, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Reaſon, and ſome inadequate conception of mind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>Dependence in Eſſence</hi> in regard of ſome moment of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before <hi>Dependence in cauſing,</hi>—yet this later really <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addes nothing to the Eſſence of a Create Being.</hi>

(1) That this Dependence of the Creature on God is ſomething really and intrinſecally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in the Creature. For al confeſſe, that paſſive Creation is in the Creature: But now Dependence is nothing elſe but <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Emanation</hi> or <hi>Creation,</hi> if we ſpeak of the firſt Creation, from God. (2) That this Dependence is a ſubſtantial or eſſential mode affecting the ſubſtance of the Creature, albeit it conſtitute not the ſame. (3) He limits this modal diſtinction to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the Creature in its firſt Emanation or Creation, but grants, that its dependence in operation is really the ſame with the Eſſence of the Creature. (4) Suppoſe we allow a modal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:42100:280"/>between the Creatures dependence and eſſence, yet who knows not, but that the moſt awakened Philoſophers now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grant, that Modes, ſpecially ſuch as are ſubſtantial and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, do not really differ from the things modified. Thus <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovius, Metaphyſ. pag.</hi> 434. <q>Dependence, ſaith he, is a mode of a create Being, agreeing to it by reaſon of its imperfection, which is not the very Eſſence of the Creature, nor yet a new Entitie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Eſſence; but ſomething affecting the create Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</q> And he cites <hi>Suarez</hi> for this his Hypotheſis.

                        <hi>importes a preſuppoſition of influence, or ſubordination, poſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and inferioritie.</hi> (1) Creatural dependence importes a <hi>preſuppoſition of influence,</hi> or <hi>ſubordination</hi> to the firſt Cauſe. This is primarily and formally included in the very notion of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, neither doth it adde any real entitie or mode diſtinct from the Creature; but explicates only the intrinſec condition and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude of the Creature relating to the omnipotent cauſalitie and influence of God. This ſubordination to God as the firſt cauſe ariſeth from the imperfection of the Creature, and the abſolute Dominion of God. And as to its latitude and extent, it regardes both natural and ſupernatural Influences and Beings. By ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Beings and Influences I mean ſuch as being above the ſphere of Nature, are not connatural to or producible by its force and power. Theſe ſupernatural Beings have cauſalities propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to their Entities, in which they are ſubordinate to God and dependent on him, as natural Beings in their kind. And in this reſpect the Creatures ſubordination to, and dependence on God in the whole of its cauſalitie, is commun both to natural and ſupernatural Beings. Yea, ſupernatural Beings, by virtue of their ſubordination to God, may be elevated and raiſed to act and cauſe ſomewhat beyond that cauſalitie which is connatural to them. For even in this regard they are not leſſe ſubordinate and ſubject to God, than natural Beings are in their kind, as <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> wel urgeth, <hi>Metaph.

I ſhal only adde thus much, that I cannot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the utmoſt extenſion of my narrow apprehenſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any medium between the extremes of this disjunctive Propoſition: Either the Human Wil muſt depend on the Divine Independent Wil of God for al its natural motions and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or God muſt depend on the Human Will in it ſelf Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, for al his Preſcience, motives of Election, and all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination as to Grace, and gratioſe operations.

(2) Again, as there is no Action in this imperfect ſtate ſo good, but it has ſome ſin mixed with it; ſo is there any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo ſinful, which has not ſome natural good as the ſubſtrate mater thereof, as we have largely proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. §. 2? (3) Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we cut off the material entitie of ſinful Acts from Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on Gods immediate concurſe, do we not indeed thereby cut off the moſt illuſtrious part of Divine Providence in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this lower world?
